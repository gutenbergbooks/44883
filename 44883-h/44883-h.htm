<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.4em;'>THE DRAMA OF LOVE</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.4em;'>AND DEATH</p>
</div>

<h1 id='t151'>CHAPTER I<br/>&ensp;<br/>INTRODUCTORY</h1>

<p><span class='sc'>Love</span> and Death move through this world of
ours like things apart—underrunning it truly, and
everywhere present, yet seeming to belong to
some other mode of existence. When Death
comes, breaking into the circle of our friends,
words fail us, our mental machinery ceases to
operate, all our little stores of wit and wisdom,
our maxims, our mottoes, accumulated from daily
experience, evaporate and are of no avail. These
things do not seem to touch or illuminate in any
effective way the strange vast Presence whose
wings darken the world for us. And with Love,
though in an opposite sense, it is the same.
Words are of no use, all our philosophy fails—whether
to account for the pain, or to fortify
against the glamour, or to describe the glory of
the experience.</p>

<p>These figures, Love and Death, move through
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_2' id='p_2'>2</a></span>
the world, like closest friends indeed, never far
separate, and together dominating it in a kind of
triumphant superiority; and yet like bitterest
enemies, dogging each other’s footsteps, undoing
each other’s work, fighting for the bodies and
souls of mankind.</p>

<p>Is it possible that at length and after ages we
may attain to liberate ourselves from their overlordship—to
dominate <i>them</i> and make them our
ministers and attendants? Can we wrest them
from their seeming tyranny over the human race,
and from their hostility to each other? Can we
persuade them to lay aside their disguise and
appear to us for what they no doubt are—even
the angels and messengers of a new order of
existence?</p>

<p>It is a great and difficult enterprise. Yet it is
one, I think, which we of this generation cannot
avoid. We can no longer turn our faces away
from Death, and make as if we did not perceive
his presence or hear his challenge. This age,
which is learning to look the facts of Nature
steadily in the face, and see <i>through</i> them, must
also learn to face this ultimate fact and look
through it. And it will surely—and perhaps only—be
by allying ourselves to Love that we shall be
able to do so—that we shall succeed in our endeavor.</p>

<p>For after all it is not in the main on account
of ourselves that we cherish a grudge against the
‘common enemy’ and dispute his authority, but
for the sake of those we love. For ourselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_3' id='p_3'>3</a></span>
we may be indifferent or acquiescent; but somehow
for those others, for those divine ones who
have taken our hearts into their keeping, we
resent the idea that <i>they</i> can perish. We refuse
to entertain the thought. Love in some
mysterious way forbids the fear of death.
Whether it be Siegfried who tramples the flaming,
circle underfoot, or the Prince of Heaven who
breaks his way through the enchanted thicket, or
Orpheus who reaches his Eurydice even in the
jaws of hell, or Hercules who wrestles with the
lord of the underworld for Alcestis—the ancient
instinct of mankind has declared in no uncertain
tone that in this last encounter Love must
vanquish.</p>

<p>It is in the name, then, of one of these gods
that we challenge the other. And yet not
without gratitude to both. For it is Azrael’s
invasion of our world, it is his challenge to <i>us</i>,
that (perhaps more than anything else) rivets our
loyalty to each other. It is his frown that
wakes friendship in human souls and causes them
to tighten the bonds of mutual devotion. In
some strange way these two, though seeming
enemies, play into each other’s hands; each holds
the secret of the other, and between them they
conceal a kindred life and some common intimate
relation. We feel this in our inmost intuitions;
we perceive it in our daily survey of human
affairs; and we find it illustrated (as I shall
presently point out) in general biology and the
life-histories of the most primitive cells. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_4' id='p_4'>4</a></span>
theme, in fact, of the interplay of Love and
Death will run like a thread-motive through this
book—not without some illumination, as I would
hope, cast by each upon the other, and by both
upon our human destiny.</p>

<h1 id='t250'>CHAPTER II<br/>&ensp;<br/>THE BEGINNINGS OF LOVE</h1>

<p>As I have just suggested, the great human problems
of Love and Death are strangely and remarkably
illustrated in the most primitive forms
of life; and I shall consequently make no apology
for detaining the reader for a few moments over
modern investigations into the subjects of cell-growth,
reproduction and death. If this chapter
is a little technical and complex in places, still
it may be worth while delaying over it, and granting
it some patient consideration, on account of
the curious light the study throws on the rest of
the book and the general questions therein discussed.</p>

<p>Love seems to be primarily (and perhaps
ultimately) an interchange of essences. The
Protozoa—those earliest cells, the progenitors
of the whole animal and vegetable kingdom—grow
by feeding on the minute particles which
they find in the fluid surrounding them. The
growth continues, till ultimately, reaching the
limit of convenient size, a cell divides into two or
more portions; and so reproduces itself. The descendant
cells or portions so thrown off are simply
continuations, by division, of the life of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_6' id='p_6'>6</a></span>
original or parent cell—so that it has not unfrequently
been said that, in a sense, these Protozoa
are immortal, since their life continues indefinitely
(with branching but without break) from generation
to generation. This form of reproduction
by simple budding or division extends even up
into the higher types of life, where it is sometimes
found side by side with the later sexual
form of reproduction, as in the case of so-called
<i>parthenogenesis</i> among insects. It is indeed a
kind of virgin-birth; and is well illustrated in the
vegetable world by the budding of bulbs, or by
the fact that a twig torn from a shrub and placed
in the ground will commonly grow and continue
the life of the parent plant; or in the lower
stages of the animal world, where, among
many of the worms, insects, sponges, &amp;c.,
the life may similarly be continued by division,
or by the extrusion of a bud or an
egg, without any sex-contact or sex-action
whatever.</p>

<p>This seems in fact to be the original and
primitive form of generation; and it obviously
depends upon <i>growth</i>. Generation is the superfluity,
the ὕβρις, of growth, and connects itself
in the first instance with the satisfaction of
hunger. First hunger, then growth, then reproduction
by division or budding. And this
process may go on apparently for many generations
without change—in the case of certain
Protozoa even to hundreds of generations. But
a time comes when the growth-power and energy
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_7' id='p_7'>7</a></span>
decay, and the vitality diminishes<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[1]</span></sup></a>—at any rate,
as a rule.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[2]</span></sup></a> But then a variation occurs. Two
cells unite, exchange fluids, and part again. It
is a new form of nourishment; it is the earliest
form of Love. It is a very intimate form of
nourishment; for it appears that in general the
nuclei themselves of the two cells are shared and
in part exchanged. And the vitality so obtained
gives the cells a new lease of life. They are
in fact regenerated. And each partner grows
again actively and reproduces itself by budding
and division as before. Sometimes the two
uniting cells will remain conjoined; and the
joint cell will then generate buds, or in some
cases enlarge to bursting point, and so, perishing
itself, break up into a numerous progeny.<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[3]</span></sup></a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_8' id='p_8'>8</a></span>
So far there seems to be but little differentiation
between Hunger and Love. Love is only
a special hunger which leads cells to obtain
nourishment from other cells of the same species;
and generation or reproduction in these early
stages, being an inevitable accompaniment of
growth, follows on the satisfaction of love just
as it follows on the satisfaction of hunger.
Rolph’s words on the relation of these two impulses
(quoted by Geddes and Thompson) are
very suggestive. He says:—“Conjugation occurs
when nutrition is diminished.... It is a necessity
for satisfaction, a growing hunger, which
drives the animal to engulf its neighbor, to
‘isophagy.’ The process of conjugation is only
a special form of nutrition, which occurs on a
reduction of the nutritive income, or an increase
of the nutritive needs.”</p>

<p>And so far there is no distinction of sex. It
is true there may be sex in the sense of union or
fusion between two individuals; but there is no
distinction of sex, in the sense of male and
female. In the Protozoa generally there is
simple union or conjugation between cells, which,
as far as can be observed, are quite similar to each
other. It is a union between similars; and it
leads to growth and reproduction. But both
union and reproduction at this early stage exist
quite independently of any distinctive sex-action,
or any differentiation of individuals into male and
female.</p>

<p>At a later period, however, Sex comes in. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_9' id='p_9'>9</a></span>
is obvious that for growth (and reproduction) two
things are necessary, which are in some degree
antagonistic to each other—on the one hand the
pursuit and capture of food, which means <i>activity</i>
and force, and on the other hand the digestion
and assimilation of the food, which means
<i>quiescence</i> and passivity. And it seems that at a
certain stage—in general, when “animals” have
already been formed by the conjunction of many
protozoic cells in co-operative colonies—this
differentiation sets in, and some individuals
specialize towards activity and the chase, while
others (of the same species) specialize towards
repose and assimilation. The two sets of
qualities are clearly only useful in combination
with each other, and yet, as I have said, they are
to some degree contrary to each other; and
therefore it is quite natural that the two corresponding
groups of individuals should form two
great branches in each race, diverse yet united.</p>

<p>These two branches are the male and female—the
active, energy-spending, hungry, food-obtaining
branch; and the sessile, non-active,
assimilative and reproductive branch. And by
the division of labor consequent on the formation
of these two branches the whole race is
benefited; but only of course on condition that
the diverse elements are reunited from time to
time. It is in the fusion of these elements that
the real quality and character of the race is
restored; and it is by their fusion that development
and reproduction are secured.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_10' id='p_10'>10</a></span>
In some of the Infusorians<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[4]</span></sup></a> there seems to be
a beginning of sex-differentiation, and fusion
takes place between two individuals slightly
differing from each other; but as we have already
seen, in most of the Protozoa the union is a
union of <i>similars</i>—that is, as far as can at present
be observed, though of course there is a great
probability that here also there is generally <i>some</i>
difference which supplies the attraction and the
value of union.<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[5]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>It is in the <i>Metazoa</i> generally, and those forms
of life which consist of co-operative <i>colonies</i> of
cells, that sex-differentiation into male and
female begins to decisively assert itself. Here—since
it is obviously impossible for all the cells of
one individual to fuse with all the cells of another—certain
special cells are set apart in each
organism for the purpose of union or conjugation;
and it seems quite natural that in the
course of time the differentiation spoken of above,
into male and female, should set in—each individual
tending to become decisively either
masculine or feminine—both in the sex-cells or
sex-apparatus, and (though in a less marked
degree) in the general ‘body’ and structure.</p>

<p>In the lower forms of life, generally, as among
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_11' id='p_11'>11</a></span>
the amphibia, fishes, molluscs, &amp;c., the male and
female sex-cells—the sperm and the germ—do not
conjugate within either of the parent bodies, but
are expelled from each, in order to meet and fuse
in some surrounding medium, like water. There
the double cell, so formed, develops into the new
individual. But in higher forms the meeting
takes place, and the first stages of development
ensue, <i>within</i> one of the bodies. And, as one
might expect, this occurs within the body of the
female. For the female, as we have said, represents
quiescence, growth, assimilation. The germ
or ovum is large compared with the spermatozoon;
it is also sessile in habit. The spermatozoon,
on the other hand, is exceedingly active.
And so it seems natural that the latter should
seek out the germ within the body of the female.
Just as, in general, the female animal remains
impassive and quiescent, and is sought out by
the male, so the female germ remains at home
within the female body, and receives its visitor or
visitors there. And the whole apparatus of
connection is symbolical of this relation. The
body of the female is the temple in which the
sacred mystery of the union or fusion of two
individuals is completed, as a means to the birth
or creation of a new individual.</p>

<p>Yet though the female is thus privileged to
be the receptacle and sanctum of the life-giving
power, it must not be thought that this argues
superiority of the female, as such, over the
male. The process of conjunction is sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_12' id='p_12'>12</a></span>
spoken of as a fertilization merely, implying
the idea that the ovum or female element is
the main thing, and that <i>this</i> only requires a
slight impulse or stimulus from the male side
for its powers of development to be started and
set in operation. But though it is true that the
ovum can in many cases of the lower forms of
life be started developing by the administration
of a chemical solution or even a mechanical
needle-prick, this development does not seem to
continue; and modern investigation shows that
in normal fecundation an absolute equality reigns,
as far as we can see, between the two contracting
parties and their contributions to the new being
that has to be formed.</p>

<p>Nothing is more astounding than the results of
these investigations; and they not only show us
that the protozoic cells (and sex-cells), instead
of being very simple in structure, are already
extremely complex, and that their changes in
the act of fertilization or fusion are <i>strangely
elaborate and systematic</i>; but they suggest that
though to us these cells may represent the
microscopic beginnings of life in its most primitive
stages, in reality they stand for the first
visible results of long antecedent operations, and
indicate highly organized and, we may say,
intelligent forces at work within them.</p>

<p>The mere process by which a primitive cell
divides and reproduces itself has an air of
demonic intelligence about it. Roughly, the
process may be described as follows. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_13' id='p_13'>13</a></span>
nucleus appears to be the most important portion
of a cell. Certainly it is so as regards the
supply of hereditary and formative material—the
surrounding protoplasm fulfilling more of a nutritive
and protective function. Within and
through the liquid of the nucleus there spreads
an irregular network of a substance which is
(for a purely accidental reason) called <i>chromatin</i>.
As long as the nucleus is at rest, this network
is fairly evenly distributed through it; but the
first oncoming of division is signalled by the
break-up of the chromatin into a limited and
definite number of short, threadlike bodies—to
which the name <i>chromosomes</i> has been given.
These <i>chromosomes</i>, after some curious evolutions,
finally arrange themselves in a line across the
middle of the nucleus; and they are apparently
governed in this operation, and the whole splitting
of the cell is governed, by a minute, starlike
and radiating centre (called <i>centrosome</i>),
which first appearing outside the nucleus and
in the general protoplasm of the cell, seems to
play a dominant part in the whole process.
This <i>centrosome</i>, when the time comes for the
cell-division, itself divides in two, and the two
starlike centres so formed (which are to become
<i>centrosomes</i> of the two new cells), slowly move
to opposite ends or poles of the original cell—all
the time, as they do so, throwing out raylike
threads or fibrils which connect them somehow
with the chromosomes and which seem to regulate
the movements of the latter, till, as described,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_14' id='p_14'>14</a></span>
the latter form themselves in a line across the
centre of the cell, transversely to the line joining
the poles. At this stage, then, we have a
tiny, starlike centrosome at each end of the cell,
and a transverse line of chromosomes between.
(Also, during the process the wall or enclosing
membrane of the nucleus has disappeared and
the general contents of cell and nucleus have
become undivided.) It is at this moment that
the real division begins. The chromosomes—of
which it is said that there are always a definite
and invariable number for every species of plant
or animal,<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[6]</span></sup></a> and which are now generally supposed
to contain the hereditary elements or
determinants of the future individual—these
chromosomes have already arranged themselves
longitudinally and end-on to each other across
the middle of the cell. They now, apparently
under the influence of the radiating points at
each pole, split longitudinally (as one splits a
log of wood)—so that each chromosome,
dividing throughout its length, contributes one
half of itself to one pole and one half to the
other. The halves so formed separate, and
approach their respective poles; and at the same
time the cell-wall constricting itself along the
equatorial line, or line of separation, soon
divides the original cell into two. Meanwhile
the chromosomes in each new division
group themselves (not round but) near their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_15' id='p_15'>15</a></span>
respective poles or centrosomes, and a new
nucleus membrane forming, encloses each group,
so that finally we have two cells of exactly the
same constitution as the original one, and with
exactly the same number and quality of chromosomes
as the original.<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[7]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>The whole process seems very strange and
wonderful. No military evolutions and formations,
no complex and mystic dance of initiates
in a temple, with advances and retreats, and
combinations and separations, and exchanges of
partners, could seem more fraught with intelligence.<a id='r8'/><a href='#f8' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[8]</span></sup></a>
Yet this is what takes place among
some of the very lowest forms of life, on the
division of a single cell into two. And it is
exactly the same, apparently, which takes place
in the higher forms of life when the single cell
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_16' id='p_16'>16</a></span>
which is the result of the fusion together of
the sperm-cell and the germ-cell, divides and
subdivides to form the ‘body’ of the creature.
As is well known, the joint cell divides first into
two; then each of the cells so formed divides
into two, making four in all; then each of
these divides into two, making eight; then each
into two again, making 16, 32, 64, and so on—till
they number the thousands, hundreds of
thousands, millions, which in effect build up
and constitute the body. And at each division
the process is carried out with this amazing
care and exactness of partition described—so that
every cell is verily continuous and of the same
nature with the original cell, and contains the
same nuclear elements, derived half from the
father and half from the mother. Yet in the
process a differentiation has set in, so that in
the end each cell becomes so far modified as to
be adapted for its special position and function
in the body—for the skin, mucous membrane,
blood corpuscles, brain, muscular tissue, and so
forth.<a id='r9'/><a href='#f9' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[9]</span></sup></a> It is worth while looking carefully at
the body of an animal, or one’s own body, in
order to realize what this means—to realize that
the entire creature, in all its form and feature,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_17' id='p_17'>17</a></span>
its coloring, marking, swiftness of limb, complexity
of brain, and so on, has provably been
exhaled from a single cell, <i>is</i> indeed that original
cell with its latent powers and virtue made manifest;
and to remember that that original cell
was itself the fusion of two parent cells, the male
and the female.</p>

<p>A word, then, upon this matter of the fusion
of the two parent cells in one. Here, again, two
very remarkable things appear. One refers to
the equality of the sexes; the other refers to
the onesidedness (or deficiency or imperfection)
which seems to be the characteristic <i>and</i> the
motive power of the phenomenon of sex.</p>

<p>With regard to the first point, we saw that
among the Protozoa conjugation occurs for the
most part between two individual cells which
are alike in size and (to all appearance) alike
in constitution; and this conjugation leads to
reproduction. But when among the higher
forms sex begins to show, the conjugating cells—sperm-cell
and germ-cell—are generally unlike
in size, and often in the higher animals extremely
unlike—as in the human <i>spermatozoon</i> and <i>ovum</i>,
of which the latter is a thousand times the
volume of the former;<a id='r10'/><a href='#f10' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[10]</span></sup></a> and this has sometimes
led, as remarked before, to an exaggerated view
of the preponderant importance of one sex. But
the curious fact seems to be that when the
spermatozoon of the human or higher animal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_18' id='p_18'>18</a></span>
penetrates the ovum, there is a preliminary
period before its nucleus actually combines with
the nucleus of the ovum, during which the
nucleus rapidly absorbs nourishment from the
surrounding protoplasm, and <i>grows</i>—grows till
it becomes of <i>exactly the same size</i> as the nucleus
of the ovum. The situation then is that there
are two nuclei of the same size and both charged
with chromatin of the same general character,
in close proximity, and waiting to fuse with
each other.</p>

<p>The product of that fusion is a new being;
and as far as can at present apparently be observed,
the parts played by the two sexes in the
process are quite equal. There may be <i>difference</i>
of function but there is no inequality. “Both
male and female cells,” says Professor Rolleston,<a id='r11'/><a href='#f11' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[11]</span></sup></a>
“prepare themselves for conjugation long before
it takes place, and neither of them can be said
to be a more active agent in fertilization than
the other. Not ‘fertilization’ but ‘fusion’ is
the keyword of the process. The mystical conception,
as old as Plato, of the male and female
as representing respectively the two halves of
a complete being, turns out to be no poetic
metaphor. As regards the essential features of
reproduction, it is a literal fact.”</p>

<p>The second remarkable point has to do with
the onesidedness of sexual conjugation, and the
complementary nature of the exchange involved.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_19' id='p_19'>19</a></span>
This is truly noteworthy and interesting. It
is evident that if the sperm-cell and germ-cell
simply coalesced, containing each the amount of
chromatin characteristic of the species—say sixteen
chromosomes in the case of the human being—the
result would be a cell with double the proper
amount, <i>say thirty-two chromosomes</i>, i.e. <i>an
amount belonging to another species</i>. “What happens
is that each of the reproductive cells, male
and female, prepares itself for conjugation <i>by getting
rid of half its</i> chromosomes. Two divisions
of the nucleus take place, <i>not</i> as in the ordinary
fashion of cell-division, when the chromosomes
split longitudinally, but in such a way that,
in each division, four of the sixteen chromosomes
(making eight in all) are bodily expelled
from the nucleus and from the cell, when they
either perish, or, in some cases, appear to help
in forming an envelope of nutritive matter
round the germ-cell. These divisions are called
‘maturation divisions,’ and until they are accomplished
fecundation is impossible.”<a id='r12'/><a href='#f12' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[12]</span></sup></a> Thus the
two nuclei, having each their number of chromosomes
reduced to half the normal number (in
this case to eight), are now ready to coalesce
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_20' id='p_20'>20</a></span>
and so form a new cell with the proper number
belonging to the species (<i>i.e.</i> sixteen). This cell
is the commencement of the new being, and,
as already described, it divides and re-divides,
and the innumerable cells so formed differentiate
themselves into different tissues, until the whole
animal is built up.</p>

<p>Says Professor E. B. Wilson:—“The one fact
of maturation that stands out with perfect clearness
and certainty amid all the controversies
surrounding it, is a reduction of the <i>number of
chromosomes in the ultimate germ [and sperm]
cells</i><a id='r13'/><a href='#f13' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[13]</span></sup></a> to one half the number characteristic of
the somatic cells. It is equally clear that this
reduction is a preparation of the germ [and
sperm] cells for their subsequent union, and a
means by which the number of chromosomes is
held constant in the species.”<a id='r14'/><a href='#f14' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[14]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>This extrusion or expulsion by each of the
conjugating cells of half its constituent elements
is certainly very strange.<a id='r15'/><a href='#f15' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[15]</span></sup></a> And it seems strangely
deliberate.<a id='r16'/><a href='#f16' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[16]</span></sup></a> Various theories have been formed
on the subject, but at present there is apparently
no satisfactory conclusion as to what exactly takes
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_21' id='p_21'>21</a></span>
place. Some think that in the one case certain
male elements are expelled, and in the other case
certain female elements; and anyhow it seems
probable that a complementary action sets in, by
which each prepares itself to supply a different
class of elements from the other, thus rendering
the conjunction more effectual. Plato has been
already quoted with regard to male and female
being only the two halves of a complete original
being. He also says (in the speech of Socrates
in the <i>Banquet</i>) that the mother of Love was
Poverty, and that Love “possesses thus far his
mother’s nature that he is ever the companion
of Want.” And it would appear that in the
most primitive grades of life the same is true,
and that two cells combine or coalesce in order
to mutually supply some want or deficiency.</p>

<p>Anyhow, in the process just described two points
stand out pretty clear: first, the exact quality
of the number of chromosomes contributed by
sperm-cell and germ-cell to the fertilized ovum—which
seems to indicate that the descendant being
has an equal heredity from each parent<a id='r17'/><a href='#f17' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[17]</span></sup></a>—though
of course it does not follow that both heredities
become equally prominent or manifest in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_22' id='p_22'>22</a></span>
descendant body; and secondly, that the same is
true of all the cells in this new body—that they
each contain the potentialities of the joint cell
from which they sprang, and therefore the potentialities
of both parents.</p>

<p>These amazing conclusions concerning the
origins of life and reproduction—here, of course,
very briefly and imperfectly presented—cannot
but give us pause. Contemplating the evolutions
and affinities of these infinitely numerous but
infinitely small organisms which build up our
visible selves, and the strange intelligence which
seems to pervade their movements, the mind
reels—somewhat as it does in contemplating the
evolutions and affinities of the unimaginable
stars.<a id='r18'/><a href='#f18' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[18]</span></sup></a> We seem, certainly, to trace the same
laws or operations in these minutest regions as
we trace in our own corporeal and mental relations.
Cells attract each other just as human
beings do; and the attraction seems to depend,
to a certain degree, on difference. The male
spermatozoon seeks the female ovum, just as the
male animal, as a rule, seeks and pursues the
female. Primitive cells divide and redivide and
differentiate themselves, building up the animal
body, just in the same way as primitive thoughts
and emotions divide and redivide and differentiate
themselves, building up the human mind.
But though we thus see processes with which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_23' id='p_23'>23</a></span>
we are familiar repeated in infinitesimal miniature,
we seem to be no nearer than before to any
‘explanation’ of them, and we seem to see no
promise of any explanation. We merely obtain
a larger perspective, and a suggestion that the
universal order is of the same character throughout—with
a suspicion perhaps that the explanation
of these processes does not lie in any
concatenation of the things themselves, but in
some other plane of being of which these concatenations
are an allegory or symbolic expression.
In portions of the following chapters I
shall trace more in detail the resemblance or
parallelism between these processes among the
Protozoa and some of our own experiences in the
great matters of Life and Love and Death.<a id='r19'/><a href='#f19' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[19]</span></sup></a></p>

<h1 id='t790'>CHAPTER III<br/>&ensp;<br/>LOVE AS AN ART</h1>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> astounding revelation of the first great love
is a thing which the youthful human being can
hardly be prepared for, since indeed it cannot
very well be described in advance, or put into
terms of reasonable and well-conducted words.
To feel—for instance—one’s whole internal
economy in process of being melted out and
removed to a distance, as it were into the keeping
of some one else, is in itself a strange physiological
or psychological experience—and one
difficult to record in properly scientific terms!
To lose consciousness never for a moment of
the painful void so created—a void and a hunger
which permeates all the arteries and organs, and
every cranny of the body and the mind, and
which seems to rob the organism of its strength,
sometimes even to threaten it with ruin; to
forego all interest in life, except in one thing—and
that thing a person; to be aware, on the
other hand, with strange elation and joy, that
this new person or presence is infusing itself
into one’s most intimate being—pervading all the
channels, with promise (at least) of marriage and
new life to every minutest cell, and causing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_25' id='p_25'>25</a></span>
wonderful upheavals and transformations in tissue
and fluids; to find in the mind all objects of
perception to be changed and different from what
they were before; and to be dimly conscious that
the reason why they are so is because the background
and constitution of the perceiving mind
is itself changed—that, as it were, there is another
person beholding them as well as oneself—all
this defies description in words, or any possibility
of exact statement beforehand; and yet the
actual fact when it arrives is overwhelming in
solid force and reality. If, besides, to the
insurgence of these strange emotions we add—in
the earliest stages of love at least—their bewildering
fluctuation, from the deeps of vain
longing and desire to the confident and ecstatic
heights of expectation or fulfilment—the very
joys of heaven and pangs of hell in swift and
tantalizing alternation—the whole new experience
is so extraordinary, so unrelated to ordinary work-a-day
life, that to recite it is often only to raise
a smile of dismissal of the subject—as it were
into the land of dreams.</p>

<p>And yet, as we have indicated, the thing, whatever
it is, is certainly by no means insubstantial
and unreal. Nothing seems indeed more certain
than that in this strange revolution in the relations
of two people to each other—called “falling
in love”—and behind all the illusions connected
with it, <i>something is happening</i>, something very
real, very important. The falling-in-love may
be reciprocal, or it may be onesided; it may
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_26' id='p_26'>26</a></span>
be successful, or it may be unsuccessful; it may
be only a surface indication of other and very
different events; but anyhow, deep down in the
sub-conscious world, <i>something</i> is happening. It
may be that two unseen and only dimly suspected
existences are becoming really and permanently
united; it may be that for a certain period, or
(what perhaps comes to the same thing) that
to a certain <i>depth</i>, they are transfusing and
profoundly modifying each other; it may be
that the mingling of elements and the transformation
is taking place almost entirely in one person,
and only to a slight degree or hardly at all in
the other; yet in all these cases—beneath the
illusions, the misapprehensions, the mirage and
the <i>maya</i>, the surface satisfactions and the
internal disappointments—something very real is
happening, an important growth and evolution
is taking place.</p>

<p>To understand this phenomenon in some slight
degree, to have some inkling of the points of
the compass by which to steer over this exceedingly
troubled sea, is, one might say, indispensable
for every youthful human creature;
but alas! the instruction is not provided—for
indeed, as things are to-day, the adult and the
mature are themselves without knowledge, and
their eyes without speculation on the subject.
Treatises on the Art of Love truly exist—and
some (for the field they cover) very good ones,
like the <i>Ars Amatoria</i> of Ovid or the <i>Kama-sutra</i>
of Vatsayana; but they are concerned mainly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_27' id='p_27'>27</a></span>
or wholly with the details and technicalities of
the subject—with the conduct of intrigues and
amours, with times and seasons, positions and
preparations, unguents and influences. It is like
instructions given to a boatman on the minutiæ
of his craft—how to contend with wind and
wave, how to use sail and oar, to steer, to tack,
to luff to a breaker, and so forth; all very good
and necessary in their way, but who is there
to point us our course over the great Ocean,
and the stars by which to direct it? The later
works on this great subject—though not despising
the more elementary aspects—will no doubt
have to proceed much farther, into the deep
realms of psychology, biological science, and
ultimately of religion.<a id='r20'/><a href='#f20' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[20]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>As we have just said, Love is concerned with
growth and evolution. It is—though as yet
hardly acknowledged in that connection—a root-factor
of ordinary human growth; for in so
far as it is a hunger of the individual, the satisfaction
of that hunger is necessary for individual
growth—necessary (in its various forms) for
physical, mental and spiritual nourishment, for
health, mental energy, large affectional capacity,
and so forth. And it is—though this too is
not sufficiently acknowledged—a root-factor of
the Evolution process. For in so far as it
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_28' id='p_28'>28</a></span>
represents and gives rise to the union of two
beings in a new form, it plainly represents a step
in Evolution, and plainly suggests that the direction
of that step will somehow depend upon the
character and quality of the love concerned.
Thus the importance, the necessity, of the study
of the art of love is forced on our attention.
It has to be no longer a subterranean, unrecognized,
and even rather disreputable cult, but an
openly acknowledged and honorable department
of human life, leading in its due time to broad
and commonsense instructions and initiations for
the young.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Casting a glance back at the love-affairs of
the Protozoa, as briefly described in the preceding
chapter, there certainly seems to be a kind of
naive charm about them. The simple and wholehearted
way in which on occasions they fuse
with one another, losing or merging completely
their own separate individualities in the process;
or again part from each other after having exchanged
essences in a kind of affectionate cannibalism;
the obvious and unconcealed relation
between love and hunger; the first beginnings
of generation; and the matter-of-fact manner in
which one person, when he finds it convenient,
divides in half and becomes two persons, and
after a time perhaps divides again and becomes
four persons, and again and again until he is
many thousands or millions—and yet it is impossible
to decide (and he himself probably is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_29' id='p_29'>29</a></span>
not quite clear) as to whether he is still one
person or different persons—all this cannot fail
to excite our admiration and respect, nor to
give us, also, considerable food for thought.</p>

<p>One of the first things to strike us, and to
suggest an application to human life, is the
importance of Love, among these little creatures,
for the health of the individual. The authors of
<i>The Evolution of Sex</i> say in one passage (p. 178):
“Without it [conjugation], the Protozoa, which
some have called ‘immortal,’ die a natural
death. Conjugation is the necessary condition
of their eternal youth and immortality. Even
at this low level, only through the fire of love
can the phœnix of the species renew its youth.”
And again, in another passage (p. 277), referring
to the conclusions of Maupas: “Already we have
noted this important result, that conjugation is
essential to the health of the species.” Thus
it appears that, in these primitive stages, fusion
more or less complete, or interchange of essences,
leads to Regeneration and renewal of vitality—and
this long before the distinct phenomena of sex
appear. It leads to Regeneration first, and so
collaterally, and at a later period, to Generation.</p>

<p>Somehow—though it is not quite clear how—this
view of the importance of love to personal
health has been sadly obscured in later and
Christian times. The dominant Christian attitude
converted love, from being an expression and
activity of the deepest human life and joy, into
being simply a vulgar necessity for the propagation
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_30' id='p_30'>30</a></span>
of the species. A violent effort was made to
wrench apart the spiritual and corporeal aspects
of it. The one aspect was belauded, the other
condemned. The first was relegated to heaven,
the second was given its <i>congé</i> to another place.
Corporeal intercourse and the propagation of
the race were vile necessities. True affection
dwelt in the skies and disdained all earthly
contacts. And yet all this was a vain effort to
separate what could not be separated. It was
like trying to take the pigments out of a picture;
to call the picture “good,” but the stuff it was
painted with “bad.”</p>

<p>And so, owing to this denial, owing to this
non-recognition of love (in all its aspects) as
necessary to personal health, thousands and
thousands of men and women through the centuries—some
“for the kingdom of heaven’s
sake,” and some for the sake of the conventions
of society—have allowed their lives to be maimed
and blighted, their health and personal well-being
ruined. The deep well-spring and source of human
activity and vitality has been desecrated and
choked with rubbish. That some sort of purpose,
in the evolution of humanity, may have been fulfilled
by this strange negation, it would be idle
to deny; indeed some such purpose—in view
of the wide prevalence of the negation, and its
long continuance during the civilization period—seems
probable. But this does not in any way
controvert the fact that it has in its time caused
a disastrous crippling of human health and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_31' id='p_31'>31</a></span>
vitality. Human progress takes place, no doubt,
in sections—one foot forward at a time, so to
speak; but this does not mean that the other
foot can be permanently left in the rear. On
the contrary, it means its all the more decided
advance when its turn arrives.</p>

<p>To-day we seem at the outset of a new era,
and preparing in some way for the rehabilitation
of the Pagan conception of the world. The
negative Christian dispensation is rapidly approaching
its close; the necessity of love in its
various forms, as part and parcel of a healthy
life, is compelling our attention. No one is
so poor a physiognomist as not to recognize the
health-giving effects of successful courtship—the
heightened color, the brilliant eye, the elastic
step; the active brain, the prompt reflexes, the
glad outlook on the world. Indeed the effect
upon all the tissues—their nourishment, growth,
improvement in tone, and so forth—is extraordinary;
and yet—remembering what has been
said about Love and Hunger—quite natural.
For, after all, we have seen that every cell in
the body is a <i>replica</i> of the original cell from
which it sprang; and so the love which reaches
one probably in some way reaches all. And
there is probably not only union and exchange
(in actual intercourse) between two special sex-cells;
but there is also (<i>all through</i> the period
of being “in love”) an etheric union and exchange
going on between the body-cells generally
on each side; and a nourishment of each
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_32' id='p_32'>32</a></span>
other by the interchange of finest and subtlest
elements.</p>

<p>That this mutual exchange and nutrition may
take place between the general cells of two bodies
is made all the more probable from the experiments
already alluded to with regard to chemical
fertilization—whereby it has been shown that
some ova or egg-cells may be started on a process
of subdivision and growth by treatment with
certain chemicals, such as weak solutions of
strychnine, or common salt, apart from any
fertilization by a spermatozoon.<a id='r21'/><a href='#f21' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[21]</span></sup></a> Now since—when
the body is once fairly formed—its further
growth and sustenance is maintained by continued
division and subdivision of the body-cells, this
stimulus to growth may easily (we may suppose)
be supplied by the subtle radiations and reactions
from another body within whose sphere of influence
it comes—radiations and reactions sufficiently
subtle to pass through the tissues to the
various cells, and of course sufficiently characteristic
and individual to be in some cases, as we
have supposed, highly vitalizing and stimulating—though
in other cases of course they may be
poisonous and harmful. Of course, also, it is
only love that supplies and is the vitalizing
relation.</p>

<p>So intense, at times, is this vitalizing force, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_33' id='p_33'>33</a></span>
so ardent the need of it, that the whole body
leaps and throbs in pain. Plato, in his poetic
way, explains the scorching sensation in all the
skin and tissues by feigning that it is caused by
the wing-feathers of the soul sprouting everywhere
(<i>i.e.</i> according to our view, in every little
cell). Nevertheless, his words on the subject are
singularly pregnant with meaning. For he says
(in the <i>Phædrus</i>): “Whenever indeed by gazing
on the beauty of the beloved object, and
<i>receiving from that beauty particles which fall and
flow in upon it</i> (and which are therefore called
‘desire’), the soul is watered and warmed, it is
relieved from its pain, and is glad; but as soon as
it is parted from its love, and for lack of that
moisture is parched, the mouths of the outlets by
which the feathers start become so closed up by
drought, that they obstruct the shooting germs;
and the germs being thus confined underneath, in
company of the desire which has been infused,
leap like throbbing arteries, and prick each at the
outlet which is closed against it; so that the soul,
being stung all over, is frantic with pain.”<a id='r22'/><a href='#f22' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[22]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>This fusion of complementaries, then, which
is the characteristic of fertilization, takes place
between the lovers—not only in respect of their
sex-cells, but probably also to a considerable
degree in respect of their body-cells. And
though with any mortal lovers the complementary
nature of the fusion can hardly be so complete as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_34' id='p_34'>34</a></span>
to restore the full glory of the race-life, yet very
near to that point it sometimes comes, filling
them with mad and immortal-seeming ecstasies,
and excusing them indeed for seriously thinking
that the wings of their souls have begun to grow!
In lesser degree this complementary fusion and
exchange is doubtless the explanation (or one
explanation) of that very noticeable point—the
strange way in which lovers after some years come
to resemble each other—in form and feature, in
facial expression, tone of voice, carriage of body,
handwriting, and all sorts of minute points.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>I suppose at this point it will be necessary to
explain that the recognition of love (in all its
aspects) as a general condition of human health,
does not mean a recommendation of wild indulgence
in any and every passion—necessary,
because in these cases it seems to be generally
assumed that the proposer of a very simple
thesis means a very great deal more than he says!
It is here that the necessity of education comes
in; for hitherto public instruction and discussion
in these matters have been so defective that folk
have been unable to talk about them except in a
hysterical way—hysterical on the one side or the
other. The <i>positive</i> value of love, its positive
cultivation as a gracious, superb, and necessary
part of our lives has hardly (at least in the
Anglo-Saxon world) entered into people’s minds.
To teach young things to love, and how to love,
to actually instruct and encourage them in the art,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_35' id='p_35'>35</a></span>
has seemed something wicked and unspeakable.
Says Havelock Ellis:<a id='r23'/><a href='#f23' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[23]</span></sup></a> “Whether or not
Christianity is to be held responsible, it cannot be
doubted that throughout Christendom there has
been a lamentable failure to recognize the supreme
importance, not only erotically but morally, of
the art of love. Even in the great revival of
sexual enlightenment now taking place around us
there is rarely even the faintest recognition that in
sexual enlightenment the one thing essentially
necessary is a knowledge of the art of love. For
the most part sexual instruction, as at present
understood, is purely negative, a mere string of
thou-shalt-nots. If that failure were due to the
conscious and deliberate recognition that while
the art of love must be based on physiological
and psychological knowledge, it is far too subtle
too complex, too personal, to be formulated in
lectures and manuals, it would be reasonable and
sound. But it seems to rest entirely on ignorance,
indifference, or worse.”</p>

<p>It is, I think, not unfair to suppose that it is
this indifference or vulgar Philistinism which is
largely responsible for the sordid commercialism
of the good people of the last century. Finding
the lute and the lyre snatched from their hands
they were fain to turn to a greater activity with
the muck-rake.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Love is a complex of human relations—physical,
mental, emotional, spiritual, and so
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_36' id='p_36'>36</a></span>
forth—all more or less necessary. And though
seldom realized complete, it is felt, and feels
itself, to be imperfect without some representation
of every side. To limit it to the expression
of one particular aspect would be totally
inadequate, if not absurd and impossible. A
merely physical love, for instance, on the sexual
plane, is an absurdity, a dead letter—the enjoyment
and fruition of the physical depending so
much on the <i>feeling</i> expressed, that without the
latter there is next to no satisfaction. At best
there is merely a negative pleasure, a relief,
arising from the solution of a previous state of
corporeal tension. And in such cases intercourse
is easily followed by depression and disappointment.
For if there is not enough of the more
subtle and durable elements in love, to remain
after the physical has been satisfied, and to hold
the two parties close together, why, the last state
may well be worse than the first!</p>

<p>But equally absurd is any attempt to limit,
for instance, to the mental plane, and to make
love a matter of affectionate letter-writing merely,
or of concordant views on political economy; or
again, to confine it to the emotional plane, and
the region of more or less sloppy sentiment; or
to the spiritual, with a somewhat lofty contempt
of the material—in which case it tends, as hinted
before, to become too like trying to paint a
picture without the use of pigments. All the
phases are necessary, or at least desirable—even
if, as already said, a quite complete and all-round
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_37' id='p_37'>37</a></span>
relation is seldom realized. The physical is desirable,
for many very obvious reasons—including
corporeal needs and health, and perhaps especially
because it acts in the way of removal of barriers,
and <i>so opens the path</i> to other intimacies. The
mental is desirable, to give form and outline to
the relation; the emotional, to provide the something
to be expressed; and the spiritual to give
permanence and absolute solidity to the whole
structure.</p>

<p>It is probably on account of this complex
nature that for any big and permanent relationship
of this kind there has to be a rather slow
and gradual culmination. All the various elements
have to be hunted up and brought into
line. Like all great ideas love has its two sides—its
instantaneous inner side, and its complex
outer side of innumerable detail. In <i>consciousness</i>
it tends to appear in a flash—simple, unique, and
unchangeable; but in <i>experience</i> it has to be
worked out with much labor. <i>All the elements
have to come into operation</i>, and to contribute
their respective quota to the total result. If we
remember what happens when the spermatozoon
and the ovum coalesce (see ch. ii. p. 19)—the
extraordinary changes and disturbances which are
induced in the chromatin elements of both nuclei,
the fusion of the nuclei, and the ultimate ranging
of the chromosomes in a line (for the formation
of the new being) in such a way that every
element is represented and contributes its share
to the process—we cannot but be struck by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_38' id='p_38'>38</a></span>
strange similarity to our own inner experience:
how love searches the heart, drags every element
of the inner nature forward from its lurking-place,
gives it definition and shape, and somehow
insists on it being represented, and, so to speak,
toeing the line. We shall return to this point
later. Here I only wish to insist on the complexity
of the process, in order to show that
for any big relationship plenty of time has to be
allowed. Whichever side of the nature—mental,
emotional, physical, and so forth—may have
happened to take the lead, it must not and
cannot monopolize the affair. It must drag the
other sides in and give them their place. And
this means time, and temporary bewilderment
and confusion. It is curious how ‘falling in
love’ has this very effect—how it paralyzes for
a time—inhibiting the mental part and even the
physical; how the smart talker becomes a dumb
ass, and the man about town a modest fool, and
the person who always does the right thing seems
compelled to do everything wrong—as if a confusion
were being created in the mind, analogous
to that which we have observed in the cells.
When we add to these considerations the extraordinary
differences between persons, and between
the proportions in which the elements of
their characters are mixed, it is obvious how extremely
complex the conditions of any one decent
love-relation must be, and what tact and patience
in the handling it may require.</p>

<p>The ignorance, therefore, which causes a young
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_39' id='p_39'>39</a></span>
man, husband or lover, to think that the hurried
completion of the sexual act is at once the initiation
and the fulfilment of love, is fatal enough.
It marks more often the end than the beginning
of the affair. For, contrariwise, time and plenty
of time has to be given in order to allow the
central radiation in each case to have its perfect
work. Is it too fanciful to suppose that the
<i>centrosome</i>, which makes its appearance in the
protozoön on its approach to conjunction, and
which seems to rule the rearrangement of the
chromatin elements within it, is the analogue
of the radiating force in human courtship which
so strangely sifts out and remoulds the elements
of the lover’s personality? Does the magic of
the centrosome correspond in some sense to the
glamour, so well known in human affairs? And
do they both proceed from some deep-hidden,
profoundly important manifestation of the life,
the energy, the divinity if you will, of the Race?</p>

<p>How strange is this matter of the glamour,
and its decisiveness in awakening love by its
presence, or leaving it cold by absence! Here
is a story of a woman who, dreadfully disfigured
in countenance by an accident in the hunting-field,
called her <i>fiancé</i> to her, and nobly offered
him his freedom; and he ... accepted it! Accepted
it, because, quite really and truly, the destruction
of her physical beauty had for him shattered
the Vision and the divinity. And here is
another similar story where, contrariwise, the
man immediately confirmed his love and devotion—because
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_40' id='p_40'>40</a></span>
for <i>him</i> the glory around her was more
illumined by her nobility of feeling than it could
be darkened by her bodily defect.</p>

<p>Such glamour, working away in the hidden
caverns of being, may at last, like Bruno’s “fabro
vulcano,” weld two souls into one, and bring
to light a real, a profound, and perhaps eternal
union. It is after all that inner union which
is the real thing; which gives all its joys to intercourse,
and penetrating down into the world
of sense, redeems that world into a thing of
glory and beauty. For the complete action of
that creative and organizing force plentiful time
must be given; and the two lovers must possess
their souls in patience till it has had its full
and perfect work. Ovid in his <i>Ars Amatoria</i>
has many lines on this subject. “Let the youth,”
he says, “with tardy passion burn, like a damp
torch” ... <i>“Non est Veneris properanda voluptas</i>”
... <i>“Quod datum ex facili longum male nutrit
amorem</i>” (Love easily granted may not long endure),
and so forth. And though these passages
no doubt refer mainly to what may be called the
practical conduct of amours, yet they have also a
very pointed application to the more important
aspects of the grand passion. A long foreground
of approach, time and tact, diffusion of magnetism,
mergence in one another, suffering, and
even pain—all these must be expected and allowed
for—though the best after all, in this as in
other things, is often the unexpected and the unprepared.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_41' id='p_41'>41</a></span>
And if the man has to allow time for all
the elements of his nature to come forward and
take their part in the great mystery, all the more
is it true that he has to give the woman time
for the fulfilling of <i>her</i> part. For in general
it may be said (though of course with exceptions)
that love culminates more slowly in women than
in men. Men concentrate obviously on the
definite part they have to play; but in women
love is more diffused and takes longer to reach
the point where it becomes an inspired and
creative frenzy of the whole being. Caresses,
tendernesses, provocation, sacrifices, and a thousand
indirect influences have to gradually conspire
to the working out of this result; and not
infrequently the situation so arising demands
great self-control on the part of the man. Yet
these things are worth while. “The real marriage,”
says some one, “takes place when from
their intense love there comes to birth another
soul—apart from each, and invisible, yet joining
them together, one hand ahold of each—a radiant
thing born of the sun and stars, which though
tender and fragile at first, grows just like a
bodily child, and leads them on, and dances with
them.”</p>

<p>They are worth while, all these labors and
troubles, and delays and sacrifices, if only out
of them can be forged a fair and infrangible
union. As in all the arts, so in the greatest
of the arts, no lasting result can be attained,
without such labor. Nor indeed without some
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_42' id='p_42'>42</a></span>
degree of pain and suffering. Young folk and
inexperienced may think it is not so. They may
think that by a lucky stroke and practically
without effort a man may write a “Blessed
Damozel” or carve in marble a “Greek Slave”;
but all experience points differently, and shows
that directly or indirectly to such works have
gone infinite labor and patience. And so to
the conceiving and shaping of a perfect alliance
between a man and a woman must always go
much of suffering—for it is by suffering that
the souls of human beings are brought into form
and carved to fitness for each other.</p>

<p>Is it seriously—when one comes to think of
it—possible to imagine love without pain?
Figure to yourself, O man, a courtship absolutely
undenied, from the first accepted, even encouraged,
with complaisantly unresisting bride,
smiling parents, fair-weather prospects, and cash
unlimited! How awfully dull! Does not the
stoutest heart quail at the suggestion? Or if
such a mating might be deemed pleasant as far
as its accessories and conditions were concerned,
could it yet be termed Love?</p>

<p>For Love, if worth anything, seems to <i>demand</i>
pain and strain in order to prove itself, and
is not satisfied with an easy attainment. How
indeed should one know the great heights except
by the rocks and escarpments? And pain often
in some strange way seems to be the measure
of love—the measure by which we are assured
that love is true and real; and so (which is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_43' id='p_43'>43</a></span>
one of the mysteries) it becomes transformed
into a great joy. Yes, if men could only understand,
here is one of the most precious of
the mysteries, and the solving of a great
riddle.</p>

<p>But that the course of true love does generally
not run smooth is understood, more or less,
by every one. And it is woman’s strange and
imperious instinct—even though at considerable
suffering to herself—to see that it <i>doesn’t</i> run
smooth. Ellis practically bases<a id='r24'/><a href='#f24' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[24]</span></sup></a> the whole of
the evolution of modesty on this instinct—reaching
far down in the animal kingdom—by which
the female constantly throws difficulties and
obstacles in the way of courtship (by her coynesses,
contrarieties, changeable moods, and so
forth); thus calling out in the male all his
ingenuity, his impetuosity, his energy, in overcoming
them; rousing dormant elements of his
nature; delaying consummation and giving time
for his character and all his qualities to concentrate;
and indirectly having a like effect
upon herself. So that ultimately by this method
a maximum of passion and agitation is produced,
and in the case of the human being love penetrates
to the very deeps and hidden caverns of
the soul. Such is the genesis of Modesty—not
by any means Nature’s <i>denial</i> of love, but rather
the crafty old dame’s method of rendering love,
by temporary obstacles, all the more insurgent
and irresistible—her method of making it less
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_44' id='p_44'>44</a></span>
superficial, of deepening the channels and rendering
them more profound.</p>

<p>Practically, and as a matter of policy, a too
easy consent to another’s love is a mistake. The
barb only sticks when the bait is withdrawn.
Ovid, it will be remembered, advises that “the
lover should be admitted by the <i>window</i>, even
when the door is quite accessible, and really
more convenient”;<a id='r25'/><a href='#f25' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[25]</span></sup></a> and most girls (though they
have not read Ovid) know instinctively that
this is the right policy! Nothing is so hateful to
a real lover as an easy, accommodating, altruistic
affection—thoroughly Christian in sentiment, and
with no more shape of its own than a pillow!
Romance flies at the mere mention of Christian
altruism; and the essence of love is romance.</p>

<p>Hence not only technical obstacles, but essential
differences are necessary to the growth of the
passion. Differences of age, differences of sex,
differences of class, temperament, hereditary
strain, learning, accomplishment, and so forth—if
not <i>too</i> great—are all necessary and valuable.
They all mean romance, and contribute to that
exchange of essences which we saw was the
primitive protozoic law. It is quite probable
that the abiding romance between the sexes—so
much greater as a rule than that between
two of like sex—is due to the fact that the
man and the woman never really understand
each other; each to the other is a figure in
cloudland, sometimes truly divine, sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_45' id='p_45'>45</a></span>
alas! quite the reverse; but never clear and
obvious in outline, as a simple mortal may be
expected to be.</p>

<p>But to return to the subject of pain and suffering.
There is something more in their work
than merely to reveal to the lover the extent
or the depth of his own love. They have something
surely to do with the inner realities of the
affair, with the moulding or hammering or welding
process whereby union is effected and, in some
sense, a new being created. It seems as if when
two naked souls approach, or come anywhere
near contact with each other, the one inevitably
burns or scorches the other. The intense chemistry
of the psychic elements produces something
like an actual flame. A fresh combination
is entered into, profound transformations are
effected, strange forces liberated, and a new personality
perhaps created; and the accomplishment
and evidence of the whole process is by no
means only joy, but agony also, even as childbirth
is.</p>

<p>All one can reasonably do is to endure. It
is no good <i>making a fuss</i>. In affairs of the
heart what we call suffering corresponds to what
we call labor or effort in affairs of the body.
When you put your shoulder to the cart-wheel
you feel the pain and pressure of the effort,
but that assures you that you are exercising a
force, that something is being done; so suffering
of the heart assures you that something is being
done in that other and less tangible world. To
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_46' id='p_46'>46</a></span>
scold and scowl and blame your loved one is
the stupidest thing you can do. And worse
than stupid, it is useless. For it can only alienate.
Probably that other one is suffering as
well as you—possibly more than you, possibly
a good deal less. What does it matter? The
suffering is there and must be borne; the work,
whatever it is, is being done; the transformation
is being effected. Do you want your beloved to
suffer instead of you, or simply because you are
suffering? Or is it Pity you desire rather than
Love.</p>

<p>On the other hand, these things borne in silence
have, I believe, an extraordinary effect. They
pull people to you by quite invisible cords. As
I have said, the fact of heart-strain and tension
shows that there is a pressure or pull being exerted
somewhere. Though the cord be invisible,
there is someone at the other end (though not perhaps
quite the one you supposed) who responds.</p>

<p>Words anyhow, in matters of love, are rather
foolish; they are worse than foolish, they are
useless; and again they are worse than useless,
for they are misleading. Love is an art. “It
must be revealed by <i>acts</i>,” says a Swiss writer,
“and not <i>betrayed</i> by words.” And Havelock
Ellis, speaking further of the mistake of relying
on declarations and asservations, says:<a id='r26'/><a href='#f26' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[26]</span></sup></a> “This
is scarcely realized by those ill-advised lovers who
consider that the first step in courtship—and
perhaps even the whole of courtship—is for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_47' id='p_47'>47</a></span>
man to ask a woman to be his wife. That is so
far from being the case that it constantly happens
that the premature exhibition of so large a demand
at once and forever damns all the wooer’s
chances.” And in another passage he says:<a id='r27'/><a href='#f27' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[27]</span></sup></a>
“Love’s requests cannot be made in words, nor
truthfully answered in words: a fine divination
is still needed as long as love lasts.”</p>

<p>Love is an art. As no mere talk can convey
the meaning of a piece of music or a beautiful
poem, so no verbal declaration can come anywhere
near expressing what the lover wants to
say. And for one very good and sufficient reason
(among others)—namely, that he does not know
himself! Under these circumstances to say anything
is almost certainly to say something misleading
or false. And the decent lover knows this and
holds his tongue. To talk about your devotion
is to kill it—moreover, it is to render it banal and
suspect in the eyes of your beloved.</p>

<p>Nevertheless though he cannot describe or explain
what he wants to say, the lover can <i>feel</i> it—is
feeling it all the time; and this feeling, like
other feelings, he can express by indirections—by
symbols, by actions, by the alphabet of deed
and gesture, and all the hieroglyphics of Life and
Art. Like the animals and the angels and all
the blessed creatures who don’t <i>talk</i>, he can communicate
in the ancient, primeval, universal
language of all creation, in the language which
is itself creation.</p>
</div>

<div class='pagination'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_48' id='p_48'>48</a></span>
<h1 id='t1577'>CHAPTER IV<br/>&ensp;<br/>ITS ULTIMATE MEANINGS</h1>

<p>“To talk about your devotion is to kill it.” Perhaps
one ought even to say that to talk at all is
to kill it! One often thinks what divine and
beautiful creatures—men and women—there are
all around, how loving and lovable, how gracious
in their charm, how grand in their destiny!—if
indeed they could only be persuaded to remain
within that magic circle of silence. And then
alas! one of these divinities begins to talk—and
it is like the fair woman in the fable, out of
whose mouth, whenever she opened it, there
jumped a <i>mouse</i>! The shock is almost more
than one can bear. Not that the shock proceeds
from the ignorance displayed—for the animals
and even the angels are deliciously ignorant—but
from the revelations which speech unconsciously
makes of certain states of the soul—from
the strange <i>falsity</i> which is too often heard in the
words, and in the very tones of the voice.</p>

<p>But Love burns this falsity away. That is
why love—even rude and rampant and outrageous
love—does more for the moralizing of
poor humanity than a hundred thousand Sunday
schools. It cleans the little human soul from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_49' id='p_49'>49</a></span>
the clustered lies in which it has nested itself—from
the petty conceits and deceits and cowardices
and covert meannesses—and all the things that
fly from the tip of the tongue directly the mouth
opens. It burns and cleans them away, and
leaves the lover speechless—but approximately
honest!</p>

<p>Love is an art, and the greatest of the Arts—and
the truth of it cannot be said in words; that
is, in any direct use of words. You may write
a sonnet, of course, to your mistress’s eyebrow;
but that is work, that is doing something; it is
or is trying to be, a work of Art—and anyhow
your mistress is not obliged to read it! Or
you may take a more decisive line to express
your feelings—by slaying your rival, for instance,
with a sword. That is allowable. But to bore
the lady with protestations, and to demand
definite replies (that is, to tell lies yourself, and
to compel her to tell lies), is both foolish and
wicked.</p>

<p>The expression of Love is a great art, and it
needs man’s highest ingenuity and capacity to
become skilled in it—but in the public mind it is
an art utterly neglected and despised, and it is
only by a very few (and those not always the
most ‘respectable’) that it is really cultivated.
It is a great art, for the same reason that the
expression of Beauty is a great art—for the
reason that Love itself (like Beauty) belongs
to another plane of existence than the plane of
ordinary life and speech.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_50' id='p_50'>50</a></span>
Speech is man’s great prerogative, which differentiates
him from the other creatures, and of
which he is, especially during the Civilization
period, so proud. The animals do not use it,
because they have not arrived at the need of
it; the angels do not use it, because they have
passed beyond the need. It belongs to the
second stage of human consciousness, that which
is founded on self-consciousness—on the rooted
consciousness of the self as something solitary,
apart from others, even antagonistic to them,
the centre (strange contradiction in terms!) even
among millions of other centres, to which everything
has to be referred. The whole of ordinary
speech proceeds, and has proceeded, from this
kind of self-consciousness—is generated from
it, describes it, analyzes it, pictures it forth and
expresses it—and in the upshot is just as muddled
and illusive and unsatisfactory as the thing it
proceeds from. And <i>Love</i>, which is <i>not</i> founded
on that kind of self-consciousness—which is
in fact the denial of self-centration—has no
use for it. Love can only say what it wants
by the language of life, action, song, sacrifice,
ravishment, death, and the great panorama of
creation.</p>

<p>Self-consciousness is fatal to love. The self-conscious
lover never ‘arrives.’ The woman
looks at him—and then she looks at something
more interesting. And so too the whole modern
period of commercial civilization and Christianity
has been fatal to love; for both these great
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_51' id='p_51'>51</a></span>
movements have concentrated the thoughts of
men on their own individual salvation—Christianity
on the salvation of their souls, and commercialism
on the salvation of their money-bags.
They have bred the self-regarding consciousness
in the highest degree; and so—though they
may have had their uses and their parts to play
in the history of mankind, they have been fatal
to the communal spirit in society, and they have
been fatal to the glad expression of the soul in
private life.</p>

<p>Self-consciousness is fatal to love, which is the
true expression of the soul. And it is curious
how (for some occult reason) the whole treatment
of the subject in our modern world drives it
along this painful mirror-lined ravine—how the
child is brought up in ignorance and darkness,
amid averted faces and frowns, and always the
thought of self and its own wickedness is thrust
upon it, and never the good and the beauty of
the loved one; how the same attitude continues
into years of maturity; how somehow self-forgetting
heroisms for the sake of love are made
difficult in modern life; how even the act of intercourse
itself, instead of taking place in the open
air—in touch with the great and abounding life
of Nature—is generally consummated in closed
and stuffy rooms, the symbols of mental darkness
and morbidity, and the breeding-ground of
the pettier elements of human nature.<a id='r28'/><a href='#f28' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[28]</span></sup></a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_52' id='p_52'>52</a></span>
We have said that for any lasting alliance, or
really big and satisfactory love-affair, plenty of
<i>time</i> should be given. Perhaps it is a good rule
(if any rule in such matters can be good) never to
act until one is practically compelled by one’s
feelings to do so. At any rate, the opposite
policy—that of letting off steam, or giving
expression to one’s sentiments, at the slightest
pressure—is an obvious mistake. It gives no
chance for the depths to be stirred, or the big
forces to come into play. Some degree, too,
of self-repression and holding back on the part
of the man gives time, as we have said, for the
woman’s love-feelings to unfold and define themselves.
But there is a limit here, and even
sympathy and consideration are not always in
place with love. There is something bigger—titanic,
elemental—which must also have its
way. And, after all, Force (if only appropriately
used) is the greatest of compliments. I think
every woman, in her heart of hearts, <i>wishes</i> to be
ravished; but naturally it must be by the right
man. This is the compliment which is the most
grateful of all to receive, because it is most
sincere; and this is the compliment which is the
most difficult of all to pay—because nothing but
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_53' id='p_53'>53</a></span>
the finest instinct can decide when it is appropriate;
and if by chance it is inappropriate the cause
is <i>ipso facto</i> ruined.</p>

<p>Nature prizes strength and power; and so
likewise does love, which moves in the heart of
Nature and shares her secrets. To regard Love
as a kind of refined and delicate altruism is, as we
have already hinted, drivelling nonsense. To the
lover in general violence is more endurable than
indifference; and many lovers are of such temperament
that blows and kicks (actual or metaphorical)
stimulate and increase their ardor.
Even Ovid—who must have been something of a
gay dog in his day—says,"<i>non nisi læsus amo</i>.”
There is a feeling that at all costs one must come
to close quarters with the beloved—if not in the
mimic battles of sex, then in quite serious and
hostile encounters. To reach the other one
somehow, to leave one’s mark, one’s impress on
the beloved—or <i>vice versa</i> to <i>be</i> reached and to
<i>feel</i> the impress—is a necessity. I sometimes
think that this is the explanation of those strange
cases in which a man, mad with love, and unable
to satisfy his passion, <i>kills</i> the girl he loves. I
don’t think it is hypothetical jealousy of a
possible other lover. I think it is something
much more direct than that—the blind urge to
reach her very actual self, even if it be only with
knife or bullet. I am sure that this is the
explanation of those many cases of unhappily
married folk who everlastingly nag at each other,
and yet will not on any account part company.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_54' id='p_54'>54</a></span>
They cannot love each other properly, and yet
they cannot leave each other alone. A strange
madness urges them into continual contact and
collision.</p>

<p>But yet possibly there is even something more
in the whole thing, on and beyond what is here
indicated. In the extraordinary and often
agonizing experiences attending the matter of
‘falling in love,’ great changes, as we have already
suggested, are being wrought in the human
being. Astounding inner convulsions and conversions
take place—rejections of old habits,
adoptions of new ones. The presence of the beloved
exercises this magical selective and reconstructive
influence—and that independently to a
large degree of whether the relation is a happy
and ‘successful’ one, or whether it is contrary and
unsuccessful. The main thing is contact, and the
coming of one person into touch with the other.</p>

<p>We have seen, in the case of the Protozoa, the
amazing fact of the ‘maturation-divisions’ and
the ‘extrusion of polar bodies’ as a preparation
for conjugation—how, when the two cells which
are about to unite approach each other, changes
take place already before they come into contact,
and half the chromatin elements from one cell
are expelled, and half the chromatin elements
also from the other. What the exact nature of
this division and extrusion may be is a thing not
yet known, but there seems every reason to believe
that it is of such a character as to leave the
residual elements on both sides complementary to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_55' id='p_55'>55</a></span>
one another—so that when united they shall restore
the total attributes of the race-life, only
perhaps in a new and unprecedented combination.
The Protozoa in fact ‘prepare’ themselves for
conjugation and realization of the race-life, by
casting out certain elements which would interfere
with this realization. And we may well ask ourselves
whether in the case of Man the convulsions
and conversions of which we have spoken have
not the same purpose and result, or something
much resembling it. Whatever really takes place
in the unseen world in the case of human Love,
we cannot but be persuaded that it is something
of very far-reaching and long-lasting import; and
to find that the process should often involve great
pain to the little mortals concerned seems readily
conceivable and by no means unnatural.</p>

<p>The complementary nature of love is a thing
which has often been pointed out—how the dark
marries the fair, the tall the short, the active the
lethargic, and so forth. Schopenhauer, in his
<i>Welt als Wille und Vorstellung</i>, has made a special
study of this subject. Plato, Darwin, and
others have alluded to it. It seems as if, in Love,
the creature—to use Dante Rossetti’s expression—feels
a “poignant thirst and exquisite hunger”
for that other one who will supply the elements
wanting in himself, who will restore the balance,
and fill up the round of the race ideal. And as
every one of us is eccentric and out of balance
and perfection on one side or another, so it almost
seems as if for every one there must be, on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_56' id='p_56'>56</a></span>
other side, a complementary character to be found—who
needs <i>something</i> at any rate of what we can
supply. And this consideration may yield us the
motto—however painfully conscious we may be
of our own weaknesses and deficiencies and follies
and vices and general ungainliness—the motto of
“Never despair!” Innocent folk, whose studies
of this subject have been chiefly perhaps derived
from penny novelettes—are sometimes inclined
to think that love is a stereotyped affair occurring
in a certain pattern and under certain conditions
between the ages of 18 and 35; and that if you
are not between these ages and are not fortunate
enough to have a good complexion and a nicely
formed aquiline nose, you may as well abandon
hope! They suppose that there is a certain thing
called a Man, and another certain thing called a
Woman, and that the combination of these two
forms a third quite stereotyped thing called Marriage,
<i>and there is an end of it</i>.</p>

<p>But by some kind of Providential arrangement
it appears that the actual facts are very different—that
there are really hundreds of thousands of
different kinds of men, and hundreds of thousands
of different kinds of women, and consequently
thousands of millions of different kinds of marriage;
that there are no limits of grace or comeliness,
or of character and accomplishment, or even
of infirmity or age, within which love is obliged
to move; and that there is no defect, of body or
mind, which is of necessity a bar—which may
not even (to some special other person) become
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_57' id='p_57'>57</a></span>
an object of attraction. Thus it is that the ugly
and deformed have no great difficulty in finding
their mates—as a visit to the seaside on a bank-holiday
speedily convinces us; a squint may be a
positive attraction to some, as it is said to have
been to the philosopher Descartes, and marks
of smallpox indispensable to others;<a id='r29'/><a href='#f29' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[29]</span></sup></a> while I
have read of a case somewhere, where the man
was immediately stirred to romance by the sight
of a wooden leg in a woman!<a id='r30'/><a href='#f30' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[30]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>But apart from these extreme instances which
may be due to special causes, the general principle
of compensation through opposites is very
obvious and marked. The fluffy and absurd
little woman is selected by a tall and statuesque
grenadier; the tall and statuesque lady is made
love to by a man who has to stand on a chair to
kiss her; the society elegant takes to a snuffy
and preposterous professor; the bookish scholar
(as in <i>Jude the Obscure</i>) to a mere whore; the
clever beauty (as in <i>L’homme qui rit</i>) to a grinning
clown; and of course the ‘wicked’ man is always
saved by the saintly woman. The masculine,
virago-like woman, on the other hand, finds a
man who positively <i>likes</i> being beaten with a
stick; and the miaowling, aimlessly amiable female
gets a bully for a husband (and one can only
say, “Serve them both right”)... Finally, the
well-formed aquiline nose insists on marrying a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_58' id='p_58'>58</a></span>
pug nose—and this apparently quite regardless
of what the other bodily and mental parts may
be, or what they may want.</p>

<p>Everyone knows cases of quite young men
who only love women of really advanced age,
beyond the limit of childbirth; and these are
curious because they seem to point to impelling
forces in love beyond and independent of generation
and race-perpetuation, and therefore lying
outside of the Schopenhauerian explanations.
And similarly we all know cases of young girls
who are deadly earnest in their affection for quite
old men, men who might well be their fathers
or grandfathers, but hardly, one would think,
their husbands. In these cases it looks as if the
young thing needs and seeks a parent as well
as a lover—the two in one, combined. And
where such love is returned, it is returned in
a kind of protective love, rather than an amative
love—or at any rate as a love in which the
protective and amative characters are closely
united.</p>

<p>Similarly there are numbers of cases in which
mature or quite grown men and women only love
(passionately and devotedly) boys and girls of
immature age—their love for them ceasing from
its ardor and intensity when the objects of devotion
reach the age, say, of twenty or twenty-one.
And in many of these cases the love is ardently
returned. Here, again, it is evidently not a case
of generation or race-perpetuation, but simply of
compensation—the young thing requiring the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_59' id='p_59'>59</a></span>
help and protection of the older, and the older
requiring an outlet for the protective instinct—a
case of exchange of essences and qualities which
(if at all decently and sensibly managed) might
well go to the building up of a full and well-rounded
life on either side.</p>

<p>In all these cases (and the above are of course
only samples out of thousands) we seem to see
an effort of the race-life to restore its total
quality—to restore it through the operation of
love—either by completing and rounding out the
life of the individuals concerned, or by uniting
some of their characteristics in the progeny. I
say ‘seem to see,’ because we cannot well suppose
that this gives a <i>complete</i> account of the matter,
or that it explains the whole meaning of Love;
but it at any rate suggests an important aspect of
the question. The full quality of the race-life is
always building itself up and restoring itself in
this manner. A process of Regeneration is always
going on. And this process, as suggested
before, is more fundamental even than Generation—or
it is a process of which Generation is
only one department.</p>

<p>Regeneration is the key to the meaning of
love—to be in the first place born again <i>in</i> some
one else or <i>through</i> some one else; in the second
place only, to be born again through a child. As
in the Protozoa, so among human beings, generation
alone can hardly be looked upon as the
primary object of conjugation; for, among the
latter, out of myriads of unions vast numbers
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_60' id='p_60'>60</a></span>
are as a matter of fact infertile, and a considerable
percentage (as indicated above) are quite
<i>necessarily</i> infertile, and yet these infertile unions
are quite as close, and the love concerned in them
quite as intense and penetrating, as in the case
of the fertile ones. “If a girl were free to choose
according to her inclinations,” says Florence Farr
in an eloquent plea for the economic independence
of women,<a id='r31'/><a href='#f31' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[31]</span></sup></a> “there is practically no doubt
that she would choose the right father for her
child, however badly she might choose a life-long
companion for herself.” In this passage the
authoress seems to suggest (perhaps following
Schopenhauer) that the generation of a perfect
child is the one main even though unconscious
purpose of love-union, and that the individual
parent-lives may instinctively be sacrificed for
this object. And there no doubt is so far truth
in this, that the tremendous forces of love often
pay little respect to the world conveniences and
compatibilities of the lovers themselves, and that
often (as indeed also among the Protozoa) the
parent’s life is rudely and ruthlessly sacrificed for
the birth of the next generation. Still, even so,
I think the statement as put here is risky, both
as a matter of fact and as a matter of theory.
Would it not be more correct or less risky to
say: “If a girl were free to choose, she would
choose the man who most completely compensated
and rounded out her own qualities, physical and
mental (and <i>so</i> would be likely to get her a fine
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_61' id='p_61'>61</a></span>
babe), even though he might not prove the best
of companions?”</p>

<p>It is curious, as we have suggested before, how
married folk often quarrel to desperation on the
surface, and yet seem to have a deep and permanent
hold on each other—returning together
again even after separation. It seems in these
cases as if they mutually obtained a stimulus
from each other, even by their strife, which they
could not get elsewhere. <i>Iræ amantium redintegratio
amoris.</i> The idea, too, that the great
and primal object of union is to be sought in
<i>the next generation</i> has something unsatisfactory
about it. Why not in <i>this</i> generation? Why
should the blessedness of mankind always be
deferred to posterity? It is not merely, I take
it, the <i>perpetuation</i> of the race which is the purpose
of love, but the perfection of the race, the
completeness and adequacy of its self-expression,
which love may make possible to-day just as well
as to-morrow. Ellen Key, in that fine book,
<i>Liebe und Ehe</i>,<a id='r32'/><a href='#f32' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[32]</span></sup></a> expresses this well when she
says: “Love seeks union, not only in connection
with the creation of a new being, but also because
two beings <i>through one another</i> may become a
new being, and a greater than either could be of
itself alone.”</p>

<p>The complementary nature of sex-attraction
was made much of by that youthful genius Otto
Weininger, who in his book, <i>Sex and Character</i>,<a id='r33'/><a href='#f33' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[33]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_62' id='p_62'>62</a></span>
has a chapter on the laws of Sexual Attractions
in which, in the true German manner, he not
only gives an algebraic formula for the different
types of men and women, but a formula also
for the force of attraction between any two
given individuals—which latter of course becomes
infinite when the two individuals are exactly
complementary to each other! Dr. Magnus
Hirschfeld, in his very interesting work, <i>Die
Transvestiten</i>,<a id='r34'/><a href='#f34' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[34]</span></sup></a> goes even more into detail than
does Weininger on the subject of the variations
of human type in special regard to sex-characteristics.
Sex-characteristics, he explains, may
be divided into four groups, of which two are
physiological, namely the primary characteristics
(the sex organs and adjuncts) and the secondary
(the hair, the voice, the breasts, and so forth);
and two are psychological or related (like love-sentiment,
mental habit, dress, and so forth).
Each of the four groups includes about four
different elements; so that altogether he tabulates
sixteen elements in the human being—each
of which may vary independently of the other
fifteen, and take on at least three possible forms,
either distinctly masculine, distinctly feminine,
or intermediate. Calculating up the number of
different types which these variations would thus
give rise to, he arrives at the figure 43,046,721!—which
figure, I think we may say, we need
not analyze further, since it is certainly quite
large enough for all practical purposes! And
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_63' id='p_63'>63</a></span>
really though we may mock a little at these
fanciful divisions and dissections of human nature,
they do help us to realize the enormous, the
astounding number of varieties of which it is
susceptible. And if again we consider that among
the supposed forty-three millions each variety
would have its counter type or complementary individual,
then we realize the enormous number
of perfect unions which would be theoretically
possible, and the enormous number of distinct and
different ways in which the race-life could thus
find adequate and admirable expression for itself.</p>

<p>However, we are here getting into a somewhat
abstract region. To return to the practical, the
complementary idea certainly seems to account
for much of human union; for though there are
but few cases in which the qualities of the
uniting parties are really quite complementary
to each other, yet it is obvious that each person
tends to seek and admire attributes in the other
which he himself possesses only in small degree.
At the same time, it must not be forgotten
that <i>some</i> common qualities and common ground
are necessary as a basis for affection, and that
sympathy and agreement in like interests and
habits are at least as powerful a bond as admiration
of opposites. It sometimes happens that
there are immense romances between people of
quite different classes and habits of life, or of
quite different race and color; and they see,
for the moment, flaming ideals and wonder-worlds
in each other. But unions in such cases
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_64' id='p_64'>64</a></span>
are doubtful and dangerous, because so often
the common ground of sympathy and mutual
understanding will be too limited; and hereditary
instincts and influences, deep-lying and deep-working,
will call the wanderers away, even from
the star which they seek to follow.</p>

<p>Sympathy with and understanding of the person
one lives with must be cultivated to the last
degree possible, because it is a condition of any
real and permanent alliance. And it may even
go so far (and should go so far) as a frank
understanding and tolerance of such person’s
<i>other</i> loves. After all, it seldom happens, with
any one who has more than one or two great interests
in life, that he finds a mate who can sympathize
with or understand them all. In that case
a certain portion of his personality is left out
in the cold, as it were; and if this is an important
portion it seems perfectly natural for him
to seek for a mate or a lover on that side too.
Two such loves are often perfectly compatible
and reconcilable—though naturally one will be
the dominant love, and the other subsidiary, and
if such secondary loves are good-humoredly tolerated
and admitted, the effect will generally be
to confirm the first and original alliance all the
more.</p>

<p>All this, however, does not mean that a man
can well be ‘in love’ with two women, for instance,
at the same time. To love is a very
different thing from being ‘in love’; and the latter
indicates a torrent-rush of feeling which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_65' id='p_65'>65</a></span>
necessarily can only move towards one person at a
time. (A standing flood of water may embrace
and surround several islands, but it cannot very
well <i>flow</i> in more than one direction at once.)
But this torrent-rush does not last forever, and in
due time it subsides into the quiescent and lake-like
stage—unless indeed it runs itself out and
disappears altogether.</p>

<p>Against this running out and disappearance it
is part of the Art of Love to be able to guard.
It has sometimes been argued that familiarity is
of necessity fatal; and that it is useless to contend
against this sinister tendency implanted in
the very nature of love itself. But this contention
contains only a very partial truth. It is
true that in physical love there is a certain
physical polarity which, like electric polarity,
tends to equate itself by contact. The exchange
of essences—which we saw as a chief phenomenon
of conjugation, from the protozoa upwards—completes
itself in any given case after a given
time; and after that becomes comparatively quiescent.
The same with the exchange of mental
essences. Two people, after years, cease to exchange
their views and opinions with the same
vitality as at first; they lose their snap and crackle
with regard to each other—and naturally, because
they now know each other’s minds perfectly,
and have perhaps modified them mutually
to the point of likeness. But this only means,
or should mean in a healthy case, that their interest
in each other has passed into another plane,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_66' id='p_66'>66</a></span>
that the <i>venue</i> of Love has been removed to
another court. If something has been lost in
respect of the physical rush and torrent, and
something in respect of the mental breeze and
sparkle, great things have been gained in the ever-widening
assurance and confidence of spiritual
unity, and a kind of lake-like calm which indeed
reflects the heavens. And under all, still in the
depths, one may be conscious of a subtle flow
and interchange, yet going on between the two
personalities and relating itself to some deep
and unseen movements far down in the heart of
Nature.</p>

<p>Of course for this continuance and permanence
of love there must be a certain amount of continence,
not only physical, but on the emotional
plane as well. Anything like nausea, created by
excess on either of these planes, has to be
avoided. New subjects of interest, and points
of contact, must be sought; temporary absences
rather encouraged than deprecated; and lesser
loves, as we have already hinted, not turned into
gages of battle. Few things, in fact, endear one
to a partner so much as the sense that one can
freely confide to him or her one’s <i>affaires de
cœur</i>; and when a man and wife have reached
this point of confidence in their relation to each
other, it may fairly then be said (however shocking
this may sound to the orthodox) that their
union is permanent and assured.</p>

<p>Nothing can, in the longer enduring values of
love, well take the place of some such chivalrous
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_67' id='p_67'>67</a></span>
mutual consideration which reaches the finest
fibres of the heart, and offers a perfect freedom
even there. Ellen Key—to quote her <i>Ueber Liebe
und Ehe</i><a id='r35'/><a href='#f35' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[35]</span></sup></a> again—says, “Fidelity [in love] can
never be promised, but may be <i>won afresh</i> every
day;” and she continues, “It is sad that this
truth—which was clear enough to the chivalrous
sentiment of the old courts of Love—must still
to-day be insisted on. One of the reasons, in
fact, which these courts gave, why love was not
compatible with Marriage, was ‘that the wife
could never expect from her husband the fine consideration
that the Lover is bound to exhibit, because
the latter only receives as a favor what the
husband takes as his right.’” To preserve love
through years and years with this halo of romance
still about it, and this tenderness of devotion
which means a daily renewed gift of freedom,
is indeed a great Art. It is a great and
difficult Art, but one which is assuredly “worth
while.”</p>

<p>The passion altogether, and in all its aspects,
is a wonderful thing; and perhaps, as remarked
before, the less said about it, the better! When
people—I would say—come (not without clatter)
and offer you their hearts, do not pay <i>too</i> much
attention. What they offer may be genuine, or
it may not—they themselves probably do not
know. Nor do <i>you</i> also fall into a like mistake,
offering something which you have not the power
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_68' id='p_68'>68</a></span>
to give—or to withhold. Silence and Time alone
avail. These things lie on the knees of the gods;
which place—though it may seem, as someone
has said, ‘rather cold and uncomfortable’—is perhaps
the best place for them.</p>

<h1 id='t2232'>CHAPTER V<br/>&ensp;<br/>THE ART OF DYING</h1>

<p><span class='sc'>We</span> have suggested in the last paper that some
day possibly we may arrive at an intelligent
handling of love and its problems, by which at
length the passion may cease to be the cause of
endless shipwreck and despair to mortals, and
become a favorable and friendly divinity obedient
to our service. Somewhat thus has been man’s
experience with all the great powers of Nature—with
fire and flood on the earth, with the winds
and lightning of heaven. With intelligent treatment
they have become his very ready helpers
and allies. And, as indicated in the outset of
this book, we may fairly expect the same conclusion
with regard to the great natural event
and process termed Death. The time has come
when we are really called upon to face up to
the fact of our decease from the present conditions
of life, physical and mental; when we are
called upon to study and to understand this fact,
and by understanding to become masters of the
change which it represents—and able to convert
it to our great use and advantage.</p>

<p>Hitherto—as I shall have occasion presently
to point out—there has been singularly little
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_70' id='p_70'>70</a></span>
study of this science, either from the clinical, the
physiological, or the psychological points of view;
and the art of dying, for example (which is the
subject of this chapter), seems to have been entirely
neglected.</p>

<p>No doubt it may be said that this is a difficult
art—difficult to study, and more difficult still to
practise; yet, after all, that seems only the more
reason for approaching it. The art of <i>avoiding</i>
death commands much attention, and there are
hundreds and thousands of books on that subject;
yet since none can really avoid the experience and
all must sooner or later pass through it, it might
be thought that the art of meeting one’s end
with discretion and presence of mind would at
least command as much attention.</p>

<p>There ought, one would say—and considering
the continual presence of this great ocean waiting
to receive us—to be lessons on the subject of
its navigation free of charge, and available for all
who wish, just as there are lessons in swimming
for sailors. And though it may be true that since,
as a rule, one cannot die more than once, it is
difficult to obtain the needed practice, yet even
so one may with perseverance get some approach
to doing so. There are a good many recorded
cases of people who have apparently died, and
after an interval of a few minutes or a few hours
have come to life again. I knew a married
lady, some years back, who after a long period
of illness was given up by the doctors, and
gradually sank till to all appearances she passed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_71' id='p_71'>71</a></span>
away. The medical man pronounced life to be
extinct, and the relatives began to make the
usual arrangements for her funeral. However,
being devoted to her children, and anxious to see
them through a critical period, she had made up
her mind <i>not</i> to die, and being a woman of strong
will she clung to her resolution. Two or three
hours elapsed, and then, to the surprise and joy
of her friends she returned from ‘the other side’—after
which she lived three or four years, sufficiently
long to carry out what was needed for
her family. And though in this case she had no
very distinct experience to report of another
state of existence, yet the fact of her ‘will to
live’ having persevered through the sleep or apparent
death of her body and upper mind, was
sufficient to convince her of survival of some sort
on a deeper plane, and to disarm all fear and
hesitation when death finally came.</p>

<p>Probably, on the ordinary mental plane, death
very much resembles sleep, and its actual arrival
is almost imperceptible; but, in the deeper
regions of the mind, there are not unfrequently
signs or suggestions of a great awakening. An
expression of ecstasy often overspreads the
features; sometimes there are sudden apparent
recognitions of friends who have already passed
away;<a id='r36'/><a href='#f36' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[36]</span></sup></a> in many cases there seems to be a great
extension of memory and perception; and in not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_72' id='p_72'>72</a></span>
a few a distinct sensation of flying or moving
upwards.<a id='r37'/><a href='#f37' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[37]</span></sup></a> To these and other similar considerations
I shall return later. At present I would
prefer to keep to the more physical aspects of
the question; but even so far, one cannot help
feeling that—whatever collateral drawbacks there
may be in death—in the way of painful illness,
parting with friends, disturbance and abandonment
of plans, and so forth—the experience
itself must be enormously interesting. Talk
about starting on a journey; but what must the
longest sea-voyage be, compared with this one,
with its wonderful vista, and visions, and voices
calling? And again, since it is an experience
that all must go through, and that countless
millons of our fellows <i>have</i> gone through and
are still continually going through, for that very
reason alone it has a fascination; and one feels
that had one the opportunity to avoid it one
would hardly wish to do so.</p>

<p>As I have said, it is curious that there is next to
no instruction or guidance commonly provided or
accessible in this matter. I mean especially on
the physical side. What are our medical folk
doing? There are lots of books on childbirth
and the science of parturition, and the best
methods of making the transition easy; but
when it comes to the end of life and the event
corresponding and complementary to birth, there
is little except silence and dismay.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_73' id='p_73'>73</a></span>
The usual course of preparation for this most
important event seems to be (barring accidents)
something as follows:—a physically unhealthy
and morally stupid life, which inevitably leads to
degenerative tendencies and ultimately to distinct
disease; then one or two breakdowns, which lead
to panic, and the summoning of doctors; then
partial recovery, and a repetition <i>da capo</i> of the
whole series, without any of the least improvement
in the general style of life; then of course
worse breakdown and panic, leading at last to
violent drugs, injections, operations, and so forth,
in the hope of prolonging existence a few hours;
and finally death arriving, not graciously, but in
the sense of a dismal defeat and rout to everybody
concerned; and to the patient a hurried,
confused and embittered end, robbed of all decency
and dignity.</p>

<p>Now this won’t do! When one thinks of the
deaths of animals—so composed on the whole—the
calm, the quietude, the dignity even, and the
absence as a rule of very acute or obvious suffering;
or when one thinks of the very similar conditions
of death among many savage peoples; one
cannot but ask, Why this difference? One cannot
but say, It really <i>will not do</i> for us ‘the heirs of
all the ages’ to go on behaving in this feeble and
foolish way—leading lives which utterly unfit us
for the inevitable end of life, and stricken with
most incompetent panic and dismay when the very
thing arrives which we have foreseen and which
we have had such ample time to prepare for.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_74' id='p_74'>74</a></span>
Death—from whatever point of view we look
at it—seems to be a break-up of the unity of the
creature.<a id='r38'/><a href='#f38' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[38]</span></sup></a> It is a dislocation and to some degree
a rending asunder. But such dislocation and
break-up may be of a healthy and normal type,
or it may be unhealthy and of the nature of
disease. In the first case it may chiefly consist
in the getting rid or shedding off of an out-worn
husk, which is simply left behind—much in the
same way as the chrysalis sheath of a moth or
other insect is left behind, or as the husks of a
growing bud or bulb are peeled off. Many an
old person seems to die in this way—the body
being the scene of little or no disturbance or
conflict, but simply withering up, while often at
the same time the spiritual nature of the man
becomes strangely luminous and penetrating.
Here there is a certain dislocation, but no painful
rending asunder. The centre of life seems
merely to retire to a more inward and subtle
region, where it perchance nourishes an even
brighter flame than before; and the outer body is
peeled off as a sort of outworn shell. But in
other cases death is undoubtedly very different.
Instead of the one centre simply withdrawing
inward in the way indicated, while at the same
time preserving almost to the last a general
unity of the creature, rebellious and insubordinate
centres spring up and introduce serious
conflict into the organism. These are of course
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_75' id='p_75'>75</a></span>
diseases, or centres of disease—either in the body,
like tumors, alien growths, nests of microbes,
and so forth; or in the mind, like violent
passions, greeds, anxieties, fears, rigid habits.
And forming thus independent centres they tear
and rend the body and mind between them till at
last death supervenes—not at all on account of
the voluntary withdrawal of the inner person to
more ethereal regions, but simply through the
destruction of the organism in which that person
functions.</p>

<p>It is evident (whatever view one may take of
that inner person and its perduration into other
regions of existence) that the former mode of
death is the more normal, natural and desirable
of the two, and the one which we should encourage
and cultivate; and that the latter is
likely to be painful, undignified, and even repulsive.</p>

<p>From this point of view, to strengthen the
organizing, regulating power of the body, as
against local growths and insurgencies, seems (in
general terms) the best line to take—the best
way of prolonging life, and of rendering death
fairly easy and negotiable. The outlying centres—as
represented by the various organs and
faculties, both of the body and of the mind—have
to be kept during life in subordination to
the main centre, and as far as possible in decent
harness and exercise, so as to become neither
too slack on the one hand, nor too rowdy and
insolent on the other. In this way, when the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_76' id='p_76'>76</a></span>
vital forces decay, these organs and faculties remain
still subservient to the central being, and
becoming comparatively quiescent make room for
its further passage and development. There are,
indeed, some cases of death, in which the whole
inner spirit and consciousness of the man seems
to pass on unchanged, while the rabble rout of
the body simply falls away, or is left behind, like
a disused garment or husk as we have said.</p>

<p>It should, however, be noted that the strengthening
of the organizing and regulating forces does
not and must not mean the introduction of rigid
and quasi-tyrannical habits (however ‘good’
such habits may be supposed to be). The interior
Person—as we shall see later—is far too
great and free to be adequately represented by
any such habits or regulations, even the ‘best,’
and they really belong to the lower mind or body.
Their dominance leads to an ossifying or woodening
and valetudinarian tendency in the organism,
which is as bad in its way as the uncontrolled
or inflammatory tendency.</p>

<p>To avoid these opposite pitfalls, and to live
sanely and sensibly, in a certain close touch with
Nature and with the roots of human life, is no
doubt difficult, especially under the ordinary
conditions of civilization; yet it is surely well
worth while—both for the sake of life itself and
for the termination of it. And to keep a certain
command of the situation during the mid-period
of one’s day is probably the best way toward
commanding the situation at the end. But the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_77' id='p_77'>77</a></span>
ordinary medical methods—with their drugs,
their stimulants, their sleeping-draughts, their
operations, their injections of morphia, serums,
and so forth, are surely acting all the time in
the opposite direction. Their tendency surely
is to confuse and weaken the central agency,
while at the same time they excite and sometimes
madden the local centres—till not unfrequently
the patient dies, confused, unconscious,
wrecked, and a mass of disorders and corruption.
The launching of a ship on the great ocean is a
thing that is prepared for, even during all the
period when the vessel is being built and perfected.
I am not a professional; but will no
one write a manual on the subject, even from
the medical and physiological point of view—How
to prepare for death.... How to go
through this great change with some degree of
satisfaction, command, and intelligence? Above
all, may we have a truce to the so common and
unworthy conspiracies between doctors, nurses,
and relatives, by which for the sake of keeping
the patient a few hours (or at most a few days)
longer alive, the unfortunate one—instead of
being let alone and allowed to die peacefully as
far as may be, and as indeed in nine cases out
of ten he himself desires—is on the contrary tormented
(defenceless as he is) with operations,
inoculations and medical insults of all kinds up
to the very last? The thing has become a
positive scandal; and though the ignorant importunities
of lay relatives may sometimes be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_78' id='p_78'>78</a></span>
deplorable, yet the prospect in one’s last moments
of falling into the hands of professionals is even
worse, and adds a new terror to dissolution. It
is at any rate a consolation to know that whatever
pains and torments of illness may have
preceded, they generally pass away before the
end; and notwithstanding such current expressions
as ‘death-agonies,’ ‘last struggle,’ and
so forth, the hour of death itself is mercifully
calm and peaceful. Walt Whitman, who, in his
hospital labors in the American Civil War,
must have been present at a vast number of
deathbeds, has recorded that in the great
majority of cases the end comes quite simply, as
an ordinary event of the day, “like having your
breakfast.” “Death is no more painful than
birth,” says Dr. Edward Clark in his book on
<i>Visions: a Study of False Sight</i>;<a id='r39'/><a href='#f39' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[39]</span></sup></a> and most
doctors will agree to the general truth of this
expression.</p>

<p>There is a certain sacredness in Death, which
should surely be respected. There is too, we
may say, in most cases, a sure instinct which
comes to the patient of what is impending and of
what is needed; and every effort should be made
to secure to the sufferer a quiet period during
which he may effect the passage, for himself, disturbed
as little as possible by the grief of friends
or the interferences of attendants.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_79' id='p_79'>79</a></span></p>

<h2 id='t2553'>II. PSYCHICAL</h2>

<p>We may now discuss the subject in hand somewhat
more from the psychical side. Not that in
these matters the physical and the psychical can
ever be completely dissociated, but that having
in the preceding section leaned more to the physical
side it may be convenient now to lean rather
to the psychical.</p>

<p>And there is certainly an advantage here—namely,
that from this side we may not unreasonably
say that the art of dying <i>can</i> be practised:
it is really possible to approach or even perhaps
to pass through Death on the mental plane, by
voluntary effort. Most people regard the loss of
ordinary consciousness (apart from sleep) with
something like terror and horror. The best way
to dispel that fear is to walk through the gate
oneself every day—to divest oneself of that consciousness,
and, mentally speaking, to die from
time to time. Then one may get accustomed to
it.</p>

<p>Of all the hard facts of Science: as that fire
will burn, that water will freeze, that the earth
spins on its axis, and so forth, I know of none
more solid and fundamental than the fact that if
you inhibit thought (and persevere) you come
at length to a region of consciousness below or
behind thought, and different from ordinary
thought in its nature and character—a consciousness
of quasi-universal quality, and a realization
of an altogether vaster self than that to which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_80' id='p_80'>80</a></span>
we are accustomed. And since the ordinary consciousness,
with which we are concerned in ordinary
life, is before all things founded on the little
local self, and is in fact <i>self</i>-consciousness in the
little local sense, it follows that to pass out of
that is to die to the ordinary self and the ordinary
world.</p>

<p>It is to die in the ordinary sense, but in another
sense it is to wake up and find that the ‘I,’ one’s
real, most intimate self, pervades the universe
and all other beings—that the mountains and the
sea and the stars are a part of one’s body and that
one’s soul is in touch with the souls of all
creatures. Yes, far closer than before. It is to
be assured of an indestructible immortal life and
of a joy immense and inexpressible—“to drink
of the deep well of rest and joy, and sit with all
the Gods in Paradise.”</p>

<p>So great, so splendid is this experience, that it
may be said that all minor questions and doubts
fall away in face of it; and certain it is that in
thousands and thousands of cases the fact of its
having come even once to a man has completely
revolutionized his subsequent life and outlook on
the world.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Of exactly how this inhibition of Thought
may be practised, and of all its collateral results
and implications it would be out of place to speak
now.<a id='r40'/><a href='#f40' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[40]</span></sup></a> Sufficient at present to say that with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_81' id='p_81'>81</a></span>
completion of this inhibition, and the realization
of the consequent change of consciousness—even
if it be only for a time—the ordinary mental self,
with all its worries, cares, limitations, imperfections,
and so forth, falls completely off, and lies
(for the time) like a thing dead; while the real
man practically passes onward into another state
of being.</p>

<p>To experience all this with any degree of fulness,
is to know that you have passed through
Death; because whatever destruction physical
death may bring to your local senses and faculties,
you know that it will not affect that deeper Self.
I mean that having already become aware of your
real self as pervading the life of other creatures,
and moving in other bodies than your so-called
own, it clearly does not so very much matter
whether the one body remains or passes. It may
make a difference certainly, but not a fatal or insuperable
difference. The vast ocean of the consciousness
into which you have been admitted will
not be profoundly affected, even by the abstraction
of a pearl-shell from its shore.</p>

<p>We have spoken of the Protozoa more than
once in these connections; and it has been said
that the Protozoa have been considered immortal
because, though they divide into separate cells
or organisms, the life remains continuous; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_82' id='p_82'>82</a></span>
because though some of the descendant cells may
die yet the life goes on—so that even in the
hundredth generation the self or ego of a particular
cell may be identical with that of the first
parent. And in the case we are considering we
have something similar, for when the common
life of souls is once recognized and experienced,
it is clear that nothing can destroy it. It simply
passes from one form to another. And we may
perhaps say that as the Protozoa attain to a kind
of immortality <i>below</i> death, or prior to its appearance
in the world, so the emancipated or
freed soul attains to immortality above and beyond
death—passing <i>over</i> death, in fact, as a mere
detail in its career.</p>

<p>I say, this heart and kernel of a great and
immortal self, this consciousness of a powerful
and continuing life within, <i>is</i> there—however
deeply it may be buried—within each person;
and its discovery is open to everyone who will
truly and persistently seek for it. And I say
that I regard the discovery of this experience—with
its accompanying sense of rest, content,
expansion, power, joy, and even omniscience and
immensity—as the most fundamental and important
fact hitherto of human knowledge and
scientific inquiry, and one verified and corroborated
by thousands and even millions of human
kind. Doubtless, as already suggested, questions
may arise and will arise as to the exact nature
of this continuing life, its exact relation to the
local personal consciousness, as well as to what
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_83' id='p_83'>83</a></span>
is called the sublimal self—how far definite
personality and memory go with it, and so forth.
These questions we may return to later. At
present let us simply rest on the experience itself.</p>

<p>When Death is at hand, or its oncoming
cannot long be delayed, there is still <i>that</i> to
remember, to revert to, to cling to. And the
more often we have made the experience our
very own, in life, the easier will it be to hold
on to at the close. Whatever physical death
may bring—in the way of pain or distress or
dislocation of faculty—there still remains that
indefeasible fact, the certainty of the survival
of the deepest, most universal portion of our
natures. In some cases this deepest consciousness
does itself remain so clear, so strong that—even
through all the obscurations of illness and bodily
weakness—death practically brings no break;
the body is shed off, more or less like a husk
or chrysalis (with effort and struggle perhaps,
but without anguish and despair); and the human
being passes on to realize under some other form
the divine life which he has already partially
entered into. I think it evident that this is
the state of affairs which we ought to put before
ourselves as the goal of our endeavor. It
would seem the only condition which secures
a sense of continuity in death, or which does
not carry with it some threat of failure or extinction.
And it suggests to us that our persistent
and unremitted effort during ordinary life
should be to realize and lay hold of this immortal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_84' id='p_84'>84</a></span>
Thing, to conquer and make our own this very
Heart of the universe. It suggests that every
magnanimous deed, every self-forgetting enthusiasm,
every great and passionate love, every determined
effort to get down into the heart and
truth of things and below the conventional crust,
does really bring us nearer to that attainment, and
hasten the day when mankind at large shall indeed
finally obtain the victory; and the passage
into and through death shall appear natural and
simple and clear of obstruction, and even in its
due time desirable.</p>

<p>It is clear, however, that in a great number
of cases this deepest consciousness, even if it
has occasionally during life been reached by the
person concerned, has not been sufficiently firmly
established to endure through times of sickness,
bodily weakness, and mental decay; while again,
perhaps in the vast majority of cases, the previous
realizations have been almost <i>nil</i>, or at most
have been too few or too slight to count for
much. What are we to say in such cases as
these? Even if with the eye of faith or philosophy
the bystander may seem to see the immortal
spark shining, what consolation or assistance is
that to the sufferer himself, who does not perceive
or feel it? What is likely to be his experience of
dissolution? and what may he fairly expect or
look to as any sort of solution of the obscure
problem?</p>

<p>To get any kind of answer to these questions
and any clear idea of what really happens in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_85' id='p_85'>85</a></span>
the great majority of cases—when the break-up
which we call dissolution arrives—it will be
necessary to analyze roughly the nature of Man.
We shall then see what are the various elements
of that nature, and what their probable destination,
respectively. And for the purpose in hand
I think we may divide the complete human
being into four sections—though remembering of
course that the classification proposed, or any such
classification, can only be very rough and tentative—namely,
into (1) the eternal and immortal
Self, of which we have already spoken; (2) the
inner personal ego or human soul; (3) the outer
personality or animal self; and (4) the actual
body. Of these, (1), the eternal Self, is the
germ or root of the whole human being; and I
think we may even say that all the sections and
elements of our human nature are really manifestations
or outgrowths from this root (though of
course in most cases unconscious of their real belonging
or their real source). Then (2), the
inner personal self or human soul, includes the
finer and subtler elements of ‘character’—which
we know so well in our friends, yet find so difficult
to describe, but which are roughly denoted
by such words as affection, courage, wit, sympathy,
love of beauty, sense of equality, freedom, self-reliance,
determination, and so forth; while (3),
the outer personality or animal soul (not at all
of course to be despised), is concerned with the
more terrestrial desires and passions like pride,
ambition, love of possession, jealousy, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_86' id='p_86'>86</a></span>
especially those that relate themselves directly to the
body, <i>e.g.</i> desires of food, drink, sex, ease, sleep,
and so forth; and finally, (4), the body, includes
all the material organs and parts. Other and intermediate
subdivisions may be and sometimes are
made, but these four will probably suffice for the
present—remembering, as already said, that they
have only a rough value: hard and fast lines and
divisions in such matters being impossible, and the
nature of man being really continuous and not
built in sections; remembering, too, with regard
to all four divisions, that the elements of them are
not at all times present in consciousness, but to a
large degree remain conscious or hidden or
subliminal.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_87' id='p_87'>87</a></span>
<h1 id='t2802'>CHAPTER IV<br/>&ensp;<br/>THE PASSAGE OF DEATH</h1>

<p><span class='sc'>Allowing</span>, then, that our human nature may
be roughly divided as above into four main constituents,
the destiny of two of these at death
seems pretty clear. It is clear that (1) the central
self remains (whether “we” know it or not) the
same as it ever was, and ever will be, eternal,
shining in glory and irradiating the world. It
goes on, to be the birth-source, may be, of
numberless lives to come. On the other hand,
it is equally clear that (4) the actual visible
tangible body dies, perishes, and is broken up.
Though it may return, in its elements and through
what we call Nature, into the great birth-source,
it ceases as an individual body to exist, and
passes even before the eyes of onlookers into
other forms. The fate of these two portions of
the human entity can hardly be doubted—of
the innermost central portion, continuance, with
but slow or secular change, if any; of the
outermost material shell, immediate decay and
dissolution.</p>

<p>What, then, may we suppose is the destiny of
the other two portions, the human and the animal
part? I think we may fairly suppose that they
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_88' id='p_88'>88</a></span>
each share to a considerable degree the destiny
of that extreme to which they are closest related.
The outer personality or animal life, (3), is most
closely related to the body. Its passions and desires
(though in themselves psychical and mental
entities) look always to the body for their expression
and satisfaction. It is difficult to suppose
them functioning <i>without</i> the body. We cannot,
for instance, very well imagine the passion for
drink without some kind of mouth or gullet
through which to work (though of course it may
carry on a sort of dream-activity by representing
these channels to itself, or creating mental images
of them). And similarly of the passion of personal
vanity, or the passion of sex: they refer
themselves always to the body, in some degree or
other.</p>

<p>It is clear then, I think, that when the body
in death breaks up, these psychic elements which
function through it and correspond to the various
parts and organs—these passions and desires, and
with them the whole animal being—are to some
extent involved in the ruin. They are (in most
cases) smitten with dire suffering and confusion.
A terrible misgiving and dismay assault them;
and with the break-up and disruption of the body
they too experience the agonies of disruption, and
foresee their own dissolution and death.<a id='r41'/><a href='#f41' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[41]</span></sup></a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_89' id='p_89'>89</a></span>
Yet to conclude from this that these elements
do absolutely perish, would, I think, be a mistake.
For these passional entities and this animal soul,
though they seek the body and manifest themselves
through it, are not the same as the body.
They have a creative power within them.<a id='r42'/><a href='#f42' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[42]</span></sup></a> The
drunkard, as suggested, deprived of his liquor,
represents furiously to himself in imagination the
act of drinking: he dreams a gullet a yard long
and an endless swallow—and in doing so he
actually moulds and modifies his swallowing apparatus.
The vain man and the sexual similarly
mould and modify their bodies; they contribute to
the building of the shapes which they use. And
this sort of process going on through the ages has
<i>created</i> the forms of the animals and mankind,
and their respective members and organs.<a id='r43'/><a href='#f43' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[43]</span></sup></a> All
these things are the expression and manifestation
and output of the psychical entities and passions
and qualities underlying—which themselves are
implicit in the world-soul, which indeed have
grown up and manifested themselves out of the
world-soul, and which still deeply though hiddenly
root back into it.</p>

<p>The most reasonable and obvious answer, then,
to the question, What becomes of the animal life
and its satellite passions when the body dies?
seems to be that under normal conditions they
die too—in the sense that they cease to be manifest.
They die, like the body, only with this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_90' id='p_90'>90</a></span>
difference, that <i>being</i> psychical—<i>i.e.</i> having a consciousness
and a self underlying, while the body
dies back into earth and air, they die back into
the psychic roots from which they originally
sprang—that is, into that form of the Self or
World-soul of which they are the manifestation—as,
for instance, in the case of the animals, into the
self or soul of the race; in the case of undeveloped
man, partly into the soul of the race and partly
into the human soul which is affiliated to the soul
of the race; and in the case of perfected man,
entirely into the human soul or inner personality
which, having now found and established its union
with the supreme and eternal Self, is no longer
dependent on the soul of the race, but has entered
into a divine and immortal life of its own.</p>

<p>Thus in entirely normal cases, both of animals
and man, we should conclude that the animal soul
at the time of bodily death may return perfectly
calmly and naturally into its own roots (as fern-fronds
die back in winter), and the whole process
may fulfil itself quite simply and graciously and
with a minimum of suffering. But this can only
be expected to happen in instances where instinctively
(as in healthy animals and primitive
men) or intentionally (as among a few of mankind)
the perfect unity, physical and mental, of
the organism has been preserved. In such cases
each desire and passion, standing in a close and
direct relationship to the spirit or self of the
whole organism, is easily and willingly indrawn
again at the appointed time; and there is little
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_91' id='p_91'>91</a></span>
or no struggle or agony. But in the great masses
of mankind—especially in the domains of civilization—where
this unity has been lost, it is easily
seen that many of the passional elements, loosed
from the true service of the informing spirit,
carry on a mad and violent career of their own;
and to curb these or reduce them to orderly acquiescence
and subordination is almost impossible.
On the contrary, with the general weakening of
the total organism they often break out into
greater activity. The ruling passions, “strong in
death,” push themselves to the fore and tyrannize
over the failing or ageing man, and render his
actual dissolution stormy and painful; and not only
so, but they sometimes generate phantasmal embodiments
of themselves which haunt the dying
man, or even become visible to outsiders.</p>

<p>Frederick Myers, dealing with this subject,<a id='r44'/><a href='#f44' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[44]</span></sup></a> invents
the term <i>psychorrhagy</i> for this tendency of
portions of the <i>psyche</i> under certain conditions to
break loose from the whole man; and thinks that
this process takes place not only at death, but
that there are some folk <i>born</i> with what he calls
a <i>psychorrhagic diathesis</i>, who are consequently
peculiarly apt for throwing off phantasms of
one kind or another. He says:<a id='r45'/><a href='#f45' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[45]</span></sup></a>—“That which
‘breaks loose’ on my hypothesis is not the whole
principle of life in the organism; rather it is
some psychical element probably of very varying
character, and definable mainly by its power of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_92' id='p_92'>92</a></span>
producing a phantasm, perceptible by one or more
persons, in some portion or other of space. I
hold that this phantasmogenetic effect may be
produced either on the mind, and consequently
on the brain of another person—in which case he
may discern the phantasm somewhere in his vicinity,
according to his own mental habit or prepossession—or
else directly on a portion of space,
‘out in the open,’ in which case several persons
may simultaneously discern the phantasm in that
actual spot.”</p>

<p>Myers then proceeds to give a great number
of very interesting and extremely well-attested
cases of such phantasms, ranging from merely
momentary apparitions of persons during their
life or at the hour of their death to the persistent
haunting of houses over a long period. And
I mention this in order to show that there is
good authority now for believing it possible not
only that phantasms may be generated by the
disintegration of the diseased or dying organism,
which will haunt the patient himself; but that
in cases the psychic elements generating these
phantasms may be powerful enough to create
a ghostly body which may endure, surviving
the earth-body, and manifesting itself to outside

So much for the fate of the outer personality
or animal part. Now with regard to (2), the
inner personality or human soul, we may ask,
What becomes of that? And the answer particularly
interests us, because it is with this section
that we—or at least the more thoughtful of mankind
generally—identify “ourselves.” It is probable
that almost any reader of these pages would
credit his “I” or “self,” not to the one universal
Being (to union with whom he may nevertheless
distantly aspire), nor to the group of terrestrial
desires and interests which we have termed the
animal being, but rather to that constellation of
nobler character which we have called the human
soul. This, he will say, is the self that truly interests,
that most deeply represents, me. Tell me,
what becomes of that?</p>

<p>I think it is obvious that in the hour of death
there are only two directions in which that human
soul can turn, in which “we” can turn. We
can turn for help either outwards toward the
region of the animal self, or inwards toward the
central universal self. And I think it equally obvious
that the latter direction can alone really
supply our need. At first no doubt it may
be natural to seek outwards; but now alas!
in the hour of dissolution the man discovers
that all that region of his nature, in which
indeed he has often found comfort before, is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_94' id='p_94'>94</a></span>
becoming involved in the ruin above described.
Large portions of his animal faculties are already
being torn away—or are sinking into lethargy
and sleep. His bodily organs are losing their
vitality; some of them have already become useless.
His mental faculties—especially the more
concrete and external faculties, like the memory
of events and names—are becoming disintegrated.
True, his general outlook may in cases seem to
become wider and more serene as death approaches,
and his inner character and personality
to become more luminous and gracious; but it is
a perilous passage on which he is embarked and in
general threatening clouds gather round. The
consciousness is painfully invaded by the lesser
mentalities which surround it; the ruling passions
domineer; silly little habits and tricks, of mind
and body, obsess the man; phantoms and delirium
overpower, or seek to overpower, him; he is astonished
and perturbed to find himself on the fringe
of a world in which figures, half-strange, half-familiar,
come and go, and force themselves upon
him with an odd persistence and a rather terrible
kind of intelligence. It requires all his presence of
mind to gather himself together, to hold his own,
to suppress the rebel rout, and to find amid all
the flux something indomitable and sure to which
to cling.</p>

<p>There is clearly only one thing to cling to—and
this must be insisted on—only that one great
redeeming universal Self of which we have
spoken: only that superb omnipresent Life which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_95' id='p_95'>95</a></span>
we find in the very central depth of our souls.
(And fortunate he who has already so far taken
refuge in this, that the wreck and ruin of the
visible world and the mortal onset of Death cannot
dislodge him!) That alone is fixed and sure;
and to that the personal man must turn.</p>

<p>And I think we may say that it is not merely
the personal soul’s highest duty and best welfare
to turn in this direction; but that in a sense and
by the law of its nature it must do so. For even
in those cases where the man does not recognize
this universal Being within, nor consciously believe
in and hold on to the same, still is it not
true that unconsciously he is very near and very
closely related? For all the great qualities which
we have already described as characterizing the
most intimate human soul, are they not just
those which must relate it to the universal Self?
I mean such things as Equality—the sense
of inner equality with all human and other
creatures; Freedom—the sense of freedom from
local and material bonds; Indifference—indifference
as to fate and destiny; Magnanimity; abounding
Charity and Love; dignity; courage; power—all
these things, are they not obviously the
qualities which dawn upon the personal soul and
color it when it is coming into touch with the
universal? Are they not the natural ‘sign and
symbol’ of union or partial union with that Self?
And more: are there not other things belonging
more distinctly to the unconscious and subliminal
region (which we shall deal with presently)—I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_96' id='p_96'>96</a></span>
mean such things as deep memory, intuition,
clairvoyance, telepathy, prophetic faculty,
and so forth—which point to the same conclusion?</p>

<p>The inner personal soul of man is surely
already conjoined to the universal, and must
cling to it by its very nature. And though the
man may not exactly be conscious of this union;
though he may hardly really know the depth of
his own nature; though, notwithstanding his own
splendid qualities of character, some thin film may
yet divide him from awareness of the all-redeeming
Presence; yet none the less that Presence
is there; and is the core and centre of
his being.</p>

<p>That being granted, it seems clear that in the
disintegration of death the inner personality
(whether consciously or unconsciously) will cling
to the eternal self within it. And this seems to
be the explanation of the part played by Religion
in the history of the world, and its close connection
with death. The different religions being
lame attempts to represent under various guises
this one root-fact of the central universal Life,
men have at all times clung to the religious
creeds and rituals and ceremonials as symbolizing
in some rude way the redemption and fulfilment
of their own most intimate natures—and this
whether consciously understanding the interpretations,
or whether (as most often) only doing so
in an unconscious or quite subconscious way.</p>

<p>Happy, I say, is the man who has so far
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_97' id='p_97'>97</a></span>
consciously taken refuge and identified himself
with the great life that the onset of death fails to
disturb or dislodge him. For him a wonderful
passage is prepared—amazing indeed and bewildering,
baffling at times and exhausting, yet
by no means dismaying or terrifying. But for
the ordinary mortal who has not yet arrived at
this—for whom the Presence (beheld perhaps
intermittently before) is now clouded and withdrawn
from his decisive reach—for such a man
it would seem best and most natural simply to
gather and compact himself together as firmly
as possible, and detaching his mind as well as he
can from its earthly entanglements and hindrances,
to launch forth boldly, and with such faith and
confidence as he can muster, on his strange
journey. There is a plant of the Syrian deserts—the
Rose of Jericho—about the size of our common
daisy plant, and bearing a similar flower,
which in dry seasons, when the earth about its
roots is turned into mere sand, has the presence
of mind to detach itself from its hold altogether
and to roll itself into a mere ball—flower, root
and all. It is then blown along the plains by the
wind and travels away until it reaches some moist
and sheltered spot, when it expands again, takes
hold on the ground, uplifts its head, and merrily
blooms once more. Like the little Rose of
Jericho, the human soul has at times to draw in
its roots (which we may compare to the animal
part) and separate them from their earthly entanglement;
even the sun in heaven, which it knows
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_98' id='p_98'>98</a></span>
distantly for the source of its life, may be obscured;
but compacting itself for the nonce
into a sturdy ball, it starts gaily on its far
adventure.</p>

<p>May we presume at all to speculate on the
soul’s actual passage out of this world and its
experiences on the way? No doubt there are
queer things to be encountered! I think it is obvious
that if the soul passes out of this terrestrial
world of ours into another state of existence
(definite, but quite imperceptible to our present
senses) there must be a borderland region in which
phenomena occur of an intermediate character—faintly
and fitfully perceptible by our present
faculties, but lacking in the solidity and regularity
of our present world; borderland phenomena in
two senses, as being due (<i>a</i>) partly to the break-up
of our present senses and the present stage
of existence, and (<i>b</i>) partly to the glimmering perception
of forms and figures belonging to a farther
stage.</p>

<p>With regard to (<i>a</i>), it is of course common
for the mind to ‘wander,’ and for all sorts
of phantoms and hallucinations to obsess and
cloud it in the last stages of illness; and these
vagaries of the mind are no doubt due to or
connected with excess or deficiency of circulation
in the brain, and morbid physical conditions of
one kind or another. But it is possible that
a wider and more general view than that may
be taken concerning them. I have already referred
the reader to the Note at the end of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_99' id='p_99'>99</a></span>
this chapter. All our desires and passions are
psychical entities, having a life and consciousness
of their own, though affiliated to the total soul
within which they work. All our organs and
functions are carried on by intelligences, similarly
affiliated yet in degree independent. Under
normal conditions “we” are unaware of these;
entities and intelligences—it is only when they
rebel that they come decisively to our notice.
In disease, mental and physical, there is rebellion.
We become painfully conscious of the independent
and often undesired activity of our
organs, and of our passions—and so, unfortunately
for them, do our friends! In morbid
states of mind and body certain functions, certain
passions, take on an independent vitality to such
a degree that at last they endue a kind of personality
and give rise to strings of phantasms
which we believe to be real. In dreams, though
there is not exactly rebellion, the higher powers
of the mental organism being at rest, the lesser
functionaries similarly display an extraordinary
and impish activity and present us with amazing
masquerades of actual life.</p>

<p>What then, we may ask, does probably happen
in the moment of death, when the organism has
become wasted and enfeebled by disease, and when
the nucleus of the man, the inner personality, has
compacted itself together into close compass in
preparation for its long journey? What happens
to all those marginal desires which have chiefly
occupied themselves with the affairs of the body
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_100' id='p_100'>100</a></span>
or lower mind—those innumerable little spirits
and imps which (as we discover in dreams, or by
closely watching our waking thoughts) are continually
planning and scheming their own little
successes and gratifications? What happens to
the thousand and one intelligences which carry
on the functions and processes of the organism?
and whose labors, now that the bodily life is
coming to an end, are no more needed? Is
there not a danger—or at least a likelihood—of
this strange masquerade of dreamland, of these
painful obsessions of disease, being repeated with
ever-increased intensity? True, that if the
organism has been kept so well in hand during
life as to cause all outlying passions and desires to
weaken and become quiescent simultaneously
with the body—or at least to go back quietly
into the kennels of a long sleep—like a pack of
hounds when the chase is over—then these
phantoms, these obsessions, may in that last hour
be conspicuous by their absence. But since in
the vast majority of cases this is not, and cannot
be so, it seems more probable that as a rule the
departing soul will make its exit, not only through
the perishing bodily part, but through a mass
of debris, as it may be called, of the mind
(chiefly though perhaps not entirely “the animal
mind”), through a cloud of tags and tatters of
mentality, thrown off in the final crisis. It seems
probable that just as the actual body, bereft at
death of its one pervading vitality, breaks out in
a mass of corruption or minute multitudinous
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_101' id='p_101'>101</a></span>
life, so there is a <i>tendency</i>, at any rate, for the
lower mind to break out into a strange ghostly
rabble—a cloud of phantasms, exhaled and projected
from the dying person. Of these phantasms
most, no doubt, are only visible to the
patient himself (though that does not render
them any more agreeable as visitors); others are
discernible by clairvoyants present; while others
again are distinctly seen even by persons at a
distance in space or time—as in the numerous
and well-authenticated instances of “wraiths.”
The picture is not altogether pleasant, but it has
a certain general congruity with admitted facts,
and with a fairly-accepted body of tradition
and theory; and provisionally I suppose we may
accept it.</p>

<p>It seems likely, then, that the passage of the inner
self, or human soul, out of life and its delivery
in another world, <i>the other side</i> of death, may
very closely correspond to Birth—to the birth of
a babe under ordinary conditions <i>into</i> this world.
Just as the babe, when being born, passes through
the lower passages of the body, so the human self
at death is expelled inwardly through all the
debris and litter of the mind, into another less
material and more subtle world than ours. And
just as the pangs of childbirth are bad—but they
are so mainly beforehand and in preparation,
while the actual delivery is swift and a vast relief—so,
in cases, the pains and anguish in
preparation for death may be great (the squealing
of demons torn from their hold on the soul,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_102' id='p_102'>102</a></span>
the cries of intelligences cut off from their coöperative
life and source of sustenance in the
body, the fears and distress of the animal mind,
the yellow fury of the passions, and the death-struggles
of the various organs!) yet the final passage
itself may be calm and gracious and friendly.</p>

<p>Anyhow, as in other cases of human experience,
it would be a mistake to depict this one as
by any means uniform in its character. On the
contrary, it is probably susceptible of great
variety. The Head of a Department (if it
becomes necessary for him to leave his post) may
find, in one case, that he is turned out, so to
speak, with kicks—that he has to run the
gauntlet of the execrations of his subordinates;
or in another case he may leave amid the expression
of every good wish, and along a path made
pleasant and easy for him; or again he may go
“trailing clouds of glory,” and with a retinue of
followers behind him, who refuse to remain now
that their leader is departing. Some such differences
possibly, and we may say probably, present
themselves in the passage of death. The experience
of childbirth varies to an extraordinary
degree. We hear of Indian tribeswomen who
only go aside for an hour while their people are
on the march, and then rejoin them again at the
next halting-place. And who knows but what
Death and the preparation for it might be as easy—if
only the doctors and the sky-pilots would
hurry up and tell us something really useful,
instead of spending their time in vivisecting the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_103' id='p_103'>103</a></span>
wretched animals, or in mumbling over ancient
creeds?</p>

<p>Now, with regard to the second kind of borderland
phenomena, (<i>b</i>), the glimmering perception
in death of forms and figures or conditions
of being belonging to a farther stage of existence:
I do not propose at present to dwell upon this
matter at any length. But with modern psychical
research there has come a good deal of evidence
to show that on deathbeds it not at all unfrequently
happens that distinct and ardent recognition
of departed friends takes place; and
though, no doubt, it may seem possible to explain
these as cases in which the simple <i>memory</i> of a
departed friend is very powerfully resuscitated,
still this explanation hardly covers a good many
cases—such as those for instance in which the
dying person was unaware that the friend had
died, and yet apparently recognized him as a
visitor from the beyond-world.<a id='r47'/><a href='#f47' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[47]</span></sup></a> Also of course,
modern research has brought forward some
amount of testimony in favor of actual communications
with the departed through the agency of
entranced mediums; so that, though this whole
matter is still <i>sub judice</i>, we may with fair reason
suppose that both in trance-conditions and in the
hour of death there are not merely apparitions
and phenomena due to disintegrations on <i>this</i> side
of the border, but also some kind of real communications
and manifestations from the other side.</p>

<p>Anyhow, it is clear that each person’s experience
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_104' id='p_104'>104</a></span>
of death is likely to depend a good deal on
the question as to where the centre of gravity of
his self-consciousness is placed; and that—as a
part of the Art of dying—the object of our endeavor
should be to throw (during life) the self-consciousness
inward into that part of our being
which is durable and immortal in its nature, into
that part in which we are united, and feel our
union, with other creatures, into that portion
where the word itself (self-consciousness) ceases
to have a petty and sinister meaning and becomes
transformed with a glorious signification. In
that case it is indeed likely that the soul may be
endowed beforehand with divine vision. It must
be our object, by throwing our consciousness
always that way, to strengthen the power of the
inner soul over the outer personality and all its
functions, and at the same time to rivet more
and more the hold of that inner soul on the One
Self (the source of all vitality and centre of limitless
power, if we only understand it so)—so that
ultimately the outer and animal personality
(though always beautiful in its nature and
not to be despised) ceases largely to have an
independent and uncoördinated vitality of its
own, or to be the scene of uncontrolled activities
and conflict, and becomes more the expression
and instrument of the inner self: to such a degree
indeed that at the dissolution of the body the
animal soul, passing into slumber, easily dies
down to its deep roots in the human soul, there
of course to await its future reawakening, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_105' id='p_105'>105</a></span>
thus leaving the latter liberated from earth-entanglement
and free to start (like the Syrian
rose) on its long journey.</p>

<p>In this freeing for the forward journey there
must, one would think, be a great sense of joy
and satisfaction—even as there must be in the
freeing of a May-fly from its water-bred pupa
into the glory of air and sunshine. Just as it
obviously is (notwithstanding some drawbacks)
a joy to the Babe to enter upon its new life,
so it may well be that to the dying person—notwithstanding
the perils of the change, the
fears of the unknown, the parting with friends,
the apparent rending of cherished ties—there is
a strange joy in shelling off the old husks, and
in getting rid of the accumulations and dead rubbish
of a lifetime. A thousand and one tiresome
old infirmities and bonds of body and mind—now
for the first time realized in their true
meaning—slip off; and the ship of the soul, “to
port and hawser’s tie no more returning,” departs
with a strange thrill and quiver upon its “endless
cruise.”</p>

<p>The details of this launch and departure we
cannot of course ordain. The mode of death is
not always within our sphere to determine. Accident
may decide, or some hereditary weakness
for which the individual can hardly be held
responsible. Some diseases are by their nature
hard upon the patient; others are kindly in their
course. In those that bring great weakness of
body there is sometimes an easy passage—the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_106' id='p_106'>106</a></span>
earthly and corporeal part relaxing its hold, while
the mind and character become heavenly-clear.
In others of an inflammatory nature, or where
there is great organic vitality, there may be severe
and prolonged struggle. Anyhow, one can imagine
the relief when the process is complete. It
is not uncommon to experience a strange expansion
of the spirit on occasions when the body
is seriously weakened by ordinary illness. What
must this expansion be when the body finally
succumbs—this sense of immensely enlarged life,
this impression of sailing forth toward a new and
boundless ocean! How strange to stand a
moment on the brink of terrestrial mortality, and
to be conscious of—to <i>see</i>, even with the inner
visual power—the shell one has left behind, with
all its commonplace and banal surroundings: concrete
indeed and material enough, but lying now
outside oneself—something almost foreign to one
and indifferent, abandoned on the very margin and
shore of real life; to stand for a moment;
and then to turn and pass inward into that
subtle and immense ethereal existence, now to be
learnt and explored, which lies within and informs
and transfuses all our solid world, and surpasses
all its boundaries!

<h2 id='t3441'>NOTE TO CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>In order not to burden this already rather lengthy
chapter with matter which may not be needed, I append
here some general considerations for those who have
not given much attention to the subject of the various
grades of consciousness in the body—considerations
tending to show that the various parts and passions
of the body and mind have a life and intelligence of
their own, and that the whole human organism is a
hierarchy (not always perfectly harmonious) of psychic
entities.</p>

<p>We generally allow of course that our central or
dominant selves are alive and conscious (though no
doubt we use those epithets with a rather sad vagueness).
But having allowed that, the extraordinary
phenomena of variable and alternating personality compel
us to admit that there may be many such centres within
one person, each of which though now buried may in
its turn become dominant and take conscious lead, and
which must therefore be credited with life and intelligence
(even if an alien life and intelligence to “our
own”). Even the most ordinary brain-centres are in
the habit of carrying on whole departments of the bodily
organization with an independent intelligence of their
own, and are sometimes liable under the influence of
some excitement (like drink, or religion, or some enthusiasm)
to take possession of the whole man and
transform him into another creature—exhibiting in doing
so a strange degree of invasive vitality and alertness.
It is quite certain that the myriad microscopic cells of
the body are alive, each with its own little particular
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_108' id='p_108'>108</a></span>
life; and the more one studies these cells the more difficult
it is not to credit them each, in their degree, with
a particular consciousness or intelligence. And each
body-organ again, composed of a congeries or colony of
body-cells, has a life of its own on and beyond that of
its component cells, and exhibits curious signs too of
intelligence and emotion, which often (especially in sickness)
affect the moods and thoughts of the entire man.</p>

<p>The whole of the subconscious world, in fact—that
world which only occasionally breaks through into the
upper consciousness—must be allowed to be alive, and
in its various degrees methodical and calculating. This
is well seen in the phenomena of dreams and of hypnotism,
in both of which the most acute and diabolical ingenuity
is often shown—as of weird imps working in
dark chambers of the brain quite unbeknown to their
supposed lord and master; or in the extraordinary phenomena
of trance and “automatic” speaking and writing;
or in telepathy and clairvoyance; or again in the craftiness
of utter lunatics; or in the strange evasions and
mental dodgery which (as just hinted) are induced by
diseases of certain organs; or in the phenomena of mental
healing, where an appeal to the subconscious intelligence
in any and every corner of the body is often followed
by extraordinary response; or in the subtle instinctive
knowledge and perception of babes, and of animals, long
before <i>self</i>-consciousness has developed; or again, in the
sly cunning of ancient dotards; or in the complex bodily
reflexes carried on perfectly unknown to ourselves during
life; or in the continued functioning of some of the
organs after death. In all these cases, and in scores of
others not mentioned, it is clear that the majority of
the processes of the human system are carried on by
minor intelligences. They are indeed carried on by
<i>crowds</i> of minor intelligences—to which we accord the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_109' id='p_109'>109</a></span>
epithet “automatic,” and which no doubt we regard as
mechanical, as long, that is, as they work smoothly and
without friction and opposition. But when they do not
do so, when pain, disease and lunacy cut in—when a
violent burn sets the epithelial cells screaming, and the
scream comes into our consciousness as the vibration of
pain; when a diseased liver twists the events of life and
the faces of our friends into malignant shape and mien;
when lust and hypochondria people the mind with phantoms;
and drink makes all the functions mad—then we
say we are “possessed with devils,” then we recognize, if
only on the dark side, the pervading intelligence or intelligences
of the body.</p>

<p>It is like the Head of a Department, as I have said,
whose subordinate officials are working under him agreeably
and harmoniously. As long as that is the case, he
may have in his mind a general outline of the working
of the Department. He probably is ignorant of most
of the details; he certainly does not know personally
many of his subordinates, but he superintends the working
of the whole. Presently, however, occurs something
of a strike or <i>émeute</i>; whereupon he discovers that vast
numbers of his men are intelligently discussing questions
or problems of whose existence he was almost ignorant;
personalities appear before him whom, before, he knew
at most only by name; and they argue their case with an
acumen and vitality which surprises him. For the first
time, in this revolt of his department, he comes to realize
the amount of intelligent activity which is at work within
it, beneath the surface. So it is with us in the case
of disease. In health we have no trouble, unity prevails.
As long as “we” are on top, and the intelligences
which carry on the body are working on friendly terms
with us, their minds do not intrude into our realm, and
we are practically unaware of them. But when through
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_110' id='p_110'>110</a></span>
our mismanagement or other cause dissension breaks out,
then indeed we realize what kind of forces they are
with which we have to deal, and of what a wonderful
hierarchy of intelligences the body is composed.<a id='r48'/><a href='#f48' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[48]</span></sup></a></p>

<h1 id='t3554'>CHAPTER VII<br/>&ensp;<br/>IS THERE AN AFTER-DEATH STATE?</h1>

<p><span class='sc'>In</span> the last chapter Death was compared to Birth,
and it was said that probably the passage of the
human soul into another world, <i>on the other
side of death</i>, exactly corresponded to Birth—to
the birth of a babe into this world. And
certainly, seeing these apparent movements <i>into</i>
the visible and <i>away</i> from it again, it is very
natural to assume that there <i>is</i> such another
and hidden world, and to speculate upon its
nature.</p>

<p>But it may fairly be asked, is there after all
any reason for supposing that there is a definite
state of existence of any kind on that side?
Is it not quite likely that there is only vacancy
and nothingness, or at best a mere formless pulp
(of ether and electrons, or whatever it may be)
out of which souls are born and into which they
return again at death? It is this question which
I propose to discuss in the present chapter.</p>

<p>Historically speaking, we know of course that
early and primitive folk, letting their imaginations
loose, peopled that ‘other side’ and rather
promiscuously, with all sorts of fairy beings and
phantom processions. Giant grizzly bears, divine
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_112' id='p_112'>112</a></span>
jackals, elves, dwarfs, satans, holy ghosts,
lunar pitris, flaming sun-gods, and so forth, ruled
and raged behind the curtain—in front of which
the shivering mortal stood. But as time went on,
the growing exactitude of thought and science
made it more and more impossible to idly accept
these imaginings; and it may be said that about
the middle of last century these cosmogonies—for
the more thoughtful among the populations
of the Western world—finally perished, and gave
place for the most part to a simple negative attitude.
It was allowed that intelligences and personalities
(human and animal) moved on <i>this</i>
side of the veil, and were plainly distinguishable
as operating in the actual world; but they, it was
held, were more or less isolated and probably
accidental products of a mechanical universe.
That mechanical arrangement of atoms, and so
forth, which we could now largely map out and
measure, and which doubtless in the future we
should be able completely to define—that was the
universe, and somehow or other included everything.
One of its properties was that it would
run down like a clock, and would eventuate in
time in a cold sun and a dead earth—and there
was an end of it! Any intelligent existence behind
or on the other side of this veil of mechanism
was too problematical to be worth discussing;
in all probability on that side was mere nothingness
and vacancy.</p>

<p>Such, very roughly stated, was the attitude of
the fairly intelligent and educated man about
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_113' id='p_113'>113</a></span>
fifty years ago, but since that time the outgrowths
of science and human inquiry have been so
astounding as to leave that position far behind.
The obvious signs of intelligence in the minutest
cells, almost invisible to the naked eye, the
very mysterious arcana of growth in such cells
(partly described in a former chapter), the
myriad action of similarly intelligent microbes,
the strange psychology of plants, and the equally
strange psychic sensitiveness (apparently) of
<i>metals</i>, the sudden transformations and variations
both of plants and animals, the existence of the X
and N rays of light, and of countless other vibrations
of which our ordinary senses render no
account, the phenomena of radium and radiant
matter, the marvels of wireless telegraphy, the
mysterious facts connected with hypnotism and
the subliminal consciousness, and the certainty
now that telepathic communication can take place
between human beings thousands of miles apart—all
these things have convinced us that the subtlest
forces and energies, totally unmeasurable by our
instruments, and saturated or at least suffused
with intelligence, are at work all around us. They
have convinced us that gloomy phrases about cold
suns and dead earths are mere sentiment and
nonsense. Cold worlds there may certainly be,
but nothing is more certain than that worlds on
worlds, and spheres on spheres, stretch behind
and beyond the actually seen—spheres so microscopic
as to totally elude us, or so vast and cosmic
as to elude, spheres of vibration which elude,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_114' id='p_114'>114</a></span>
spheres of other senses than ours, spheres
aerial, ethereal, magnetic, mental, subliminal.
The iris-veil of our ordinary existence may truly
be rent, but the visible world, the world we
know, is no longer now a film on the surface
of an empty bubble, but a curtain concealing
a vast and teeming life, reaching down endless,
in layer on layer, into the very heart of the
universe. And whereas, in the former time of
which I have been speaking, we might have
agreed that life could not well continue after
the death of the body, to-day we should, as a
first guess, be inclined to think that life is <i>more</i>
full and rich on the other side of death than
on this side. “I do not doubt,” says Whitman,
“that from under the feet and beside the hands
and face I am cognizant of, are now looking
faces I am not cognizant of, calm and actual faces—I
do not doubt interiors have their interiors,
and exteriors have their exteriors, and that the
eyesight has another eyesight, and the hearing
another hearing, and the voice another voice.”</p>

<p>We come, then, to this problem of Death and
Birth in a similarly modified spirit, and with a
predisposition to believe that they do really indicate
passages from one definite world or plane or
region of existence to another. And here is the
place to point out, and to guard ourselves against,
a common error in the use of the word Death.
Death is not a <i>state</i>. There may be an after-death
state; but death itself is the <i>passage</i> into
that state, or—better—the passage out of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_115' id='p_115'>115</a></span>
present state. So Birth is not a state. There
may be a pre-birth state; but birth itself is
the passage into the present state. Either we
pass through death into another life and condition
of being; or else we are extinguished.
In the former case there is clearly no <i>state</i> of
death; and in the latter case there is no such
state—because there is no self to <i>be</i> dead
or to know itself dead. As Lucretius says,<a id='r49'/><a href='#f49' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[49]</span></sup></a>
endeavoring to disabuse man of the fear of the
grave:—</p>

<div class='poetry-container'><div class='lgp'>
<p class='line0'>“So to be mortal fills his mind with dread,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Forgetting that in real death can be</p>
<p class='line0'>No self, to mourn that other self as dead,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Or stand and weep at death’s indignity.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Birth and Death, then, we may look upon as
two contrary movements, to some degree complementary
and balancing each other; and it is
possible that thus, from consideration of the one,
we may be able to infer things about the other.
One such thing that we may be able to infer is
that Love presides over, or is intimately associated
with, both movements.</p>

<p>The connection of Love with Birth is of course
obvious. In some profound yet hidden way, almost
throughout creation, the birth or generation
of one creature is connected with the precedent
love and sex-fusion of two others. And
the connection of Love with Death, though not
so prominent, can similarly almost everywhere
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_116' id='p_116'>116</a></span>
be traced. The whole of poetry in literature
teems with this subject; and so does the poetry
of Nature! If we are to believe the Garden
of Eden story, Love and Death came into the
world together; and it certainly is curious that
in the age-long evolution of animal forms the
same thing seems to have happened. The Protozoa
at first, propagating by simple division,
were endued with a kind of immortality. But
then came a period when a pair found they
could enter into a joint life of renewed fecundity
by fusing with each other. They literally died
in each other, and rose again in a numerous
progeny; so that love and death were simultaneous
and synonymous. Sometimes parturition
and death were simultaneous. The mother-cell
perished in the very act of giving birth to her
brood. Then again came the aggregation of cells
into living groups—the formation of ‘colonial’
organisms; and it was then that distinctive sex-differentiation
and sex-organs appeared, and with
the capacity of sex also the capacity of death
through the disruption of the colony. Everywhere
love is associated with death. The expenditure
of seed in the male animal is an
incipient death; the formation of the seed
vessel, and the glory and color of the flowering
plant, are already the signs of its decay.
“Both Weismann and Goette,” say Geddes and
Thomson,<a id='r50'/><a href='#f50' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[50]</span></sup></a> “note how many insects (locusts,
butterflies, ephemerids, and so forth) die a few
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_117' id='p_117'>117</a></span>
hours after the production of ova. The exhaustion
is fatal, and the males are also involved.
In fact, as we should expect from the katabolic
temperament, it is the males which are especially
liable to exhaustion.... Every one is familiar
with the close association of love and death in
the common May-flies. Emergence into winged
liberty, the love-dance, and the process of fertilization,
the deposition of eggs, and the death of
both parents, are often the crowded events of a
few hours. In higher animals, the fatality of
the reproductive sacrifice has been greatly lessened,
yet death may tragically persist, even in
human life, as the direct Nemesis of love.”</p>

<p>George Macdonald, in one of his books
(<i>Phantastes</i>, vol. i. p. 191), feigns a race of
beings, for whom death is not so much the
‘nemesis’ of love, as its natural and inevitable
outcome. Seized by a great love, too great for
mortal expression, “looking <i>too</i> deep into each
other’s eyes,” they (with great presence of mind,
it must be said!) breathe their souls out in death,
and so take their departure to another world.
Heine touches the same note in his poem, the
“Asra”:—</p>

<div class='poetry-container'><div class='lgp'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“Ich bin aus Jemen,</p>
<p class='line0'>Und mein stamm sind jene Asra,</p>
<p class='line0'>Welche sterben wenn sie lieben.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>And scores of scarcely noticed paragraphs in
our daily papers, brief tales of single or double
suicide, present us with a dim outline of how—even
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_118' id='p_118'>118</a></span>
in the mean conditions and surroundings
of our modern days—every now and then there
comes to one or other a longing, a passion, and a
revelation of a desire so intense, that, breaking
the bounds of a useless life, it demands swift utterance
in death.</p>

<p>Some deep and profound suggestion there is in
all this—some hint of a life whose very form and
nature is love, and which finds its deliverance and
nativity only through the abandonment of the
body—even as our ordinary life, conceived in
love, finds its delivery into this world through
what we call birth. At the very least it suggests
that Death may have a great deal more to do
with Love, and may be more deeply allied to it
than is generally supposed. And it may suggest
that the two things, being in some sense the most
important occupations of the human race, should
be frankly recognized as such, and should both be
accordingly prepared for.</p>

<p>Another thing, about which we may be able to
infer something from the analogy between Birth
and Death, is the fate of the soul at death. If
we can trace in any way the relation of the soul
to the body at the time of the first appearance of
the latter, that may shed light on the relation
which will hold at its disappearance. We cannot
certainly define very strictly what we mean by
the word ‘soul’; but we are all very well aware
that associated with our bodies, and in some sense
pervading them with its intelligence, is a conscious
(as well as subconscious) being which we call the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_119' id='p_119'>119</a></span>
self or soul; and we are all puzzled at times to
understand what is the relation between this and
the body. Now we have seen (ch. ii.) the genesis
of the body from a single fertilized cell or
germ almost microscopic in size, and its growth
by continual and myriadfold division into, say,
a human form; and we have seen that every cell
in the perfect and final form—every cell, of
eye, or liver, or of any part or organ—is there
by linear descent or division from that first
cell, though variously adapted and differentiated
during the process. We are therefore almost
compelled to conclude that that intelligent self
(conscious or subconscious) which we are so distinctly
aware of as associated with our mature
bodies was there also, associated with the first
germ.<a id='r51'/><a href='#f51' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[51]</span></sup></a> It may not truly have been outwardly
manifest or unfolded into evidence at that primitive
stage. It could not well be. But it was
there, even in its totality, and unless it had been
there, we could not now be what we are. The
conscious and subconscious self has been within
us all along, unfolding and manifesting itself
with the unfoldment and development of the
body; and indeed to all appearances guiding
that development. And more, we may fairly
say—having regard to the mode of development
of the tissue—that it dwells even in its entirety
within every normal and healthy cell of our
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_120' id='p_120'>120</a></span>
present bodies, and is the formative essence
thereof.</p>

<p>Let me give an illustration. Sometimes in the
morning you may see a bush glittering all over
with dewdrops; every leaf has such a tiny jewel
hanging from it. If now you look you will see
in each dewdrop a miniature picture of the far
landscape. Or, to take a closer illustration,
some shrubs have, embedded in the very tissue
of their leaves, tiny transparent and lens-like
glands which yield to close scrutiny similar
miniatures of the world beyond. Exactly, then,
like these plants, we may think of the whole
human body as trembling in light—each cell containing
(if we could but see it!) a luminous
image of the presiding genius or self of the
body.</p>

<p>The question is often asked: <i>Where</i> is the
self? does it reside in the head, or in the heart,
or perhaps in the liver? is it an aural halo
pervading and surrounding the body, or is it a
single microscopic cell far hidden in the interior,
or is it an invisible atom? Here apparently is the
answer. It animates <i>every</i> cell. It pervades the
whole body, and seeks expression in every part
of it. Some cells, as we have said before, are
differentiated so as to express especially <i>this</i>
faculty, others to express especially <i>that</i>; but
the human soul or self stands behind them all.
Look at a baby’s face, and its growing sparkling
expression—an individual being coming newly
into the world, obviously seeking, feeling,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_121' id='p_121'>121</a></span>
tentatively finding its way forward—every morning a
thinnest veil falling from its features! Playing
through the whole body, is an intelligence, seeking
expression. Helen Keller, the girl both deaf
and blind, describes most graphically her agonizing
experiences at the age of six or seven, when
her growing powers of body and mind demanded
the expression which her physical disabilities so
cruelly denied. “The desire to express myself
grew,”<a id='r52'/><a href='#f52' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[52]</span></sup></a> she says; “the few signs I used became
less and less adequate, and my failures to make
myself understood were invariably followed by
outbursts of passion. I felt as if invisible hands
were holding me, and I made frantic efforts to
free myself.” And then most touching, the description
of her relief, “the thrill of surprise, the
joy of discovery,” when she at last, about the age
of ten, was able to utter her first intelligible
words. In some degree like Helen Keller’s is
perhaps the experience of every babe that is born
into the world.</p>

<p>It seems to me, therefore, that each person is
practically compelled to think of his ‘self’ as
moving behind or as associated with or animating
every cell in the healthy body; and as having
been so associated with the first germ of the same,
even though that was a thing well-nigh invisible
to the naked eye. You were there, you are
there now, at the root of your bodily life. You
may not, certainly, except at moments, be distinctly
conscious of this your complete relation
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_122' id='p_122'>122</a></span>
to the body; but, as we have already said, the
term self must be held to include the large subconscious
tracts which occasionally flash up
into consciousness, and which, when they do so
flash, almost always confirm this relation; nor
must we lose from sight the still more deeply
buried physiological or animal soul, whose operations
we seem to be able to trace from earliest
days, guiding all the complex of organic growth
and development, and apparently conscious in
its own way with a very wonderful sort of intelligence.<a id='r53'/><a href='#f53' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[53]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>All this compels us, I think, not only to picture
to ourselves the mental self or soul as associated
with the body, and taking part in its development
from the first inception of the latter; but also
to picture that self as in its entirety considerably
<i>greater</i> and more extensive than the ordinary
conscious self, and even as greater than any bodily
expression or manifestation which it succeeds
in gaining. We are compelled, I think, to
regard the real self as at all times only <i>partially</i>
manifested.</p>

<p>I think this latter point is obvious; for when,
and at what period in life, is manifestation complete?
Certainly not in babyhood, when the
faculties are only unfolding; certainly not in
old age, when they are decaying and falling away.
Is it, then, in maturity and middle life? But
during all that period the output of expression
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_123' id='p_123'>123</a></span>
and character in a man is constantly changing;
and which of all these changes of raiment is completely
representative? Do we not rather feel
that to express our real selves <i>every</i> phase from
childhood through maturity even into extreme
old age ought to be taken into account? Nay,
more than that; for have we not—perhaps most
of us—a profound feeling and conviction that
there are elements deep down in our natures,
which never have been expressed, and never can
or will be expressed in our present and actual
lives? Do we not all feel that our best is only a
fraction of what we want to say? And what must
we think of the strange facts of multiple personality?
Do they not suggest that our real self has
facets so opposite, so divergent, that for a long
time they may appear quite disconnected with each
other; until ultimately (as has happened in actual
cases) they have been visibly reconciled and harmonized
in a new and more perfect character?</p>

<p>With regard to this view that the real person
is so much greater than his visible manifestation,
Frederick Myers and Oliver Lodge have used
the simile of a ship. And it is a fine one. A
ship gliding through the sea has a manifestation
of its own, a very partial one, in the waterworld
below—a ponderous hull moving in the upper
layers of that world—a form encrusted with
barnacles and sea-weed. But what denizen of
the deep could have any inkling or idea of the
real life of that ship in the aerial plane—the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_124' id='p_124'>124</a></span>
glory of sails and spars trimmed to the breeze
and glancing in the sun, the blue arch of heaven
flecked with clouds, the leaping waves and the
boundless horizon around the ship as she speeds
onward, the ingenious provision for her voyage,
the compass, the helmsman and the captain directing
her course? Surely (except in moments of
divination and inspiration) we have little idea of
what we really are! But there <i>are</i> such moments—moments
of profound grief, of passionate
love, of great and splendid angers and
enthusiasms which dart light back into the
farthest recesses of our natures and astonish us
with the vision they disclose. And (perhaps
more often) there are moments which disclose
the wonder-self in others. If we do not recognize
(which is naturally not easy!) our own divinity,
it is certain that we cannot really <i>love</i> without
discovering a divine being in the loved one—a
being remote, resplendent, inaccessible, who
calls for and indeed demands our devotion, but
of whom the mortal form is most obviously a
mere symbol and disguise. There are times
when this strange illumination falls on people
at large, and we see them as gods walking: when
we look even on the tired overworked mother
in the slum, and her face is shining like heaven;
or on the ploughboy in the field with his team,
and see the mould and the material of ancient
heroes. Yet of what is really nearest to them
all the time these folk say nothing, and we are
astonished to find them haggling over halfpence
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_125' id='p_125'>125</a></span>
or seriously troubled about wire-worms. It is
as if a play, or some kind of deliberate mystification,
were being carried on—with disguises a
little too thin. We see, as plain as day—and
nothing can contravene our conclusion—that it
is only a fraction of the real person that is
concerned.</p>

<p>Your self, then, I say—covering by that word
not only all that you and your friends usually
include in it, but probably a good deal more—existed,
with all its potentialities and capacities
even in association with the first primitive germ
of your present body.<a id='r54'/><a href='#f54' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[54]</span></sup></a> That germ was microscopic
in size, and its inner workings and transformations
were ultra-microscopic in character.
We do not know whence they originated; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_126' id='p_126'>126</a></span>
whether we think of the soul which was associated
with them as ultra-microscopic in <i>its</i> nature
or as fourth-dimensional does not much matter.
We only perceive that it, the soul, must have
been there, in an unseen world of some kind,
pushing forward toward its manifestation in the
visible.<a id='r55'/><a href='#f55' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[55]</span></sup></a> I do not think we can well escape this
conclusion.</p>

<p>But if we conclude that the soul existed before
Birth, or, more properly, at or before conception,
in some such invisible world, then that it should
so exist after Death is equally possible, nay,
probable. For after conception, by continual
multiplication and differentiation of cells, the
soul framed for itself organs of expression and
manifestation, and thus gradually came into our
world of sight and sense and ordinary intelligence;
and so, by some reverse process, we may
suppose that in decay and death the soul gradually
loses these organs and their coördination,
and retires into the invisible. Whatever the nature
of this invisible may be—whether, as I say,
a world of things too minute for human perception,
or too vast for the same, or whether a
world which eludes us by the simple artifice of
everywhere and in everything running parallel
to the things of the world—only in another
dimension imperceptible to us—in any case it
seems reasonable to suppose that the soul is
still <i>there</i>, fulfilling its nature and its destiny,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_127' id='p_127'>127</a></span>
of which its earth-life has only been one
episode.<a id='r56'/><a href='#f56' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[56]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>And if the apparent loss of consciousness (the
loss of the ordinary consciousness at any rate)
which often takes place during the death-change,
seems to point to extinction and not to continuance,
I think that that need not disturb us. For
in sleep, in our nightly sleep, the same suspension
of the ordinary consciousness takes place, as we
very well know; yet all the time the subconsciousness
is functioning away—sorting out sounds,
bidding us wake for some, allowing us to sleep
through others, discriminating disturbances, carrying
on the physiologies of the body, posting
sentinels in the reflexes—and guarding us from
harm—till untired in the morning it knits together
again the ravelled thread of the ordinary
consciousness and renews our waking activities.
And if this happens in our ordinary and nightly
sleep, it seems at any rate possible that something
similar may happen in death. Indeed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_128' id='p_128'>128</a></span>
there is much evidence to show that while at the
hour of death the supraliminal consciousness often
passes into a state of quiescence or abeyance,
the subliminal, or at any rate some portion of
the subliminal, becomes unusually active. Audition
grows strangely keen—so much so that it is
sometimes difficult to tell whether the things
heard have been apprehended by extension of the
ordinary faculty or whether by a species of clairaudience.
Vision similarly passes into clairvoyance,
the patient becomes extraordinarily sensitive
to telepathic influences, and knows what is
going on at a distance;<a id='r57'/><a href='#f57' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[57]</span></sup></a> and not only so, but
he radiates influences <i>to</i> a distance. All the
phenomena of wraiths and dying messages, now
so well substantiated—of apparitions and impressions
projected with force at the moment of
death into the minds of distant friends—prove
clearly the increased activity and vitality (one
may say) of the subliminal self at that time; and
this points, as I say, not to extinction and disorganization,
but perhaps to the transfer of consciousness
more decisively into hidden regions of
our being. One hears sometimes of a dying person
who, prevented from departure by the tears
and entreaties of surrounding friends, cries out
“Oh! <i>let</i> me die!” and one remembers the case,
above mentioned, of the apparently dead mother
who, so to speak, called herself back to life by
the thought of her orphaned children. Such
cases as these do not look like loss of continuity;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_129' id='p_129'>129</a></span>
rather they look as if a keen intelligence were
still there, well aware of its earth-life, but drawn
onward by an inevitable force, and passing into a
new phase, of swifter subtler activity in perhaps
a more ethereal body.</p>

<p>That the human soul does pass through great
transformations—moultings and sloughings and
metamorphoses—and so forward from one stage
to another, we know from the facts of life.
Physiologically the body takes on a new phase at
birth, and another at weaning and teething, and
another at puberty, and another in age at the
‘change of life,’ and so on; and transformations
of the soul or inner life (some of them very remarkable)
are associated with these outer phases.
The last great bodily change is obviously accompanied—as
we have just indicated—by the development
or extension of hidden psychic powers.
What exactly that final transformation may be,
we can only at present speculate; but we can see
that, like the others, when it arrives it has already
become very necessary and inevitable. At every
such former stage—whether it be birth, or teething,
or puberty, or what not—there has been
constriction or strangulation. The growing inner
life has found its conditions too limited for it,
and has burst forth into new form and utterance.
In this final change the bodily conditions altogether
seem to have grown too limited. With
an irresistible impulse and an agonizing joy of
liberation the soul sweeps out, or is fearfully
swept, into its new sphere. Sometimes doubtless
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_130' id='p_130'>130</a></span>
the passage is one of pain and terror; far more
often, and in the great majority of cases, it is
peaceful and calm, with a deep sense of relief;
occasionally it is radiant with ecstasy, as if the
new life already cast its splendor in advance.<a id='r58'/><a href='#f58' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[58]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Yes, we cannot withhold the belief that there
is an after-death state—a state which in a sense
is present with us, and has been present, all our
lives; but which—for reasons that at present we
can only vaguely apprehend—has been folded
from our consciousness.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_131' id='p_131'>131</a></span>
<h1 id='t4157'>CHAPTER VIII<br/>&ensp;<br/>THE UNDERLYING SELF</h1>

<p><span class='sc'>Allowing</span>, then, the great probability of the existence
of an after-death state, and of a survival
of some kind, the question further arises: Is that
survival in any sense personal or individual? or
does it belong to some, so to speak, formless
region, either below or above personality? It is
conceivable of course that there may be survival
of the outer and beggarly elements of the mind,
below personality; or it is conceivable that the
deepest and most central core of the man may
survive, far beyond and above personality; but in
either case the <i>individual</i> existence may not continue.
The eternity of the All-soul or Self of
the universe is, I take it, a basic fact; it is from
a certain point of view obvious; we have already
discussed it, and, as far as this book is concerned,
it is treated so much as an axiom that to argue
further without it would be useless. That being
granted, it follows that if the soul of each human
being roots down ultimately into that All-self,
the core of each soul <i>must</i> partake of the eternal
nature. But as far as it does so it <i>may</i> be beyond
all reach or remembrance or recognition of personality.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_132' id='p_132'>132</a></span>
Such a conclusion—whatever force of conviction
may accompany it—is certainly not altogether
satisfactory. I remember that once—in
the course of conversation with a lady on this very
subject—she remarked that though she thought
there would be a future life she did not believe in
the continuance of individuality. “What do you
believe in, then?” said I. “Oh,” she replied,
“I think we shall be a sort of Happy Mass!”
And I have always since remembered that expression.</p>

<p>But though the idea of a happy mass has its
charms, it does not, as I say, quite satisfy either
our feelings or our intelligence. There is a
desire for something more, and there is a perception
that Differentiation and Individuation
represent a great law—a law so great as probably
to extend even to the ultimate modes of Being.
And though a vague generality of this kind
cannot stand in the place of strict reasoning or
observation, it may make us feel that personal
survival is at any rate possible, and that a certain
amount of speculation on the subject is legitimate.</p>

<p>At the same time we have to bear in mind
that the subject altogether is a very complex one,
and that we have to move only slowly, if we
want to move forward at all, and to avoid having
to retrace our steps. We must not too serenely
assume, for instance, that we at all know what we
are! We have already (ch. v.) analyzed to some
degree the constitution of the human being, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_133' id='p_133'>133</a></span>
found it complicated enough in its successive
planes of development. We have now to remember
that—at least on the two middle planes,
those of the human soul and the animal soul—there
is another subdivision to be made, namely
between that part which is conscious and that
which is only subconscious; so that further complications
inevitably arise. We may not only
have to consider, as in the chapter referred to,
which of these planes may possibly carry survival
with it, but again whether such survival may be
in the conscious region, or only in the subliminal
or subconscious. This chapter will be largely occupied
with a consideration of the subliminal or
underlying portion of the self, and it will be
seen that that is probably of immense extent and
variety of content compared with the surface or
conscious portion; but it will also be seen that
there is no strict line of demarcation between the
two, and that a continual interchange betwixt
them is taking place, so that for the present
at any rate it is safest to give the word ‘self’
its widest scope and make it include both portions
and every mental faculty, rather than limit its
application.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>In attacking the subject, then, of the Survival
of the Self, I suppose our first question ought
to be: What is the test of survival, what do
we mean by it? And to this, I imagine, the
answer is, Continuity of Consciousness. This
would seem to be the only satisfying definition.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_134' id='p_134'>134</a></span>
Consciousness is necessary in some form or other,
as the base and evidence of our existence; and
continuity in some degree is also necessary, in
order to link our experiences together, as it were
into one chain. Continuity, however, need not
be absolute. The chain of consciousness may
apparently be broken by sleep, or it may be
broken by a dose of chloroform, or by a blow
on the head; but it may be re-knit and resumed.
It may pass from the supraliminal state to the
subliminal, and again emerge on the surface.
It may even be discontinuous; but as long as
Memory bridges the intervals we get the <i>sense</i> of
continuity of life or personality.<a id='r59'/><a href='#f59' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[59]</span></sup></a> Supposing a
body of memories—of life say in some village
of ancient Egypt—suddenly opened up in one’s
mind, as vivid and consistent and enduring as
one’s ordinary memory of childhood days, it
would be natural to conclude that one really had
pre-existed in that village; it would be difficult
not to make that inference. And similarly if
at some future time, and in far other than our
present surroundings, the memory of this one’s
earth-life should emerge again, vivid and personal
as now, the being thus having that memory would,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_135' id='p_135'>135</a></span>
we suppose, conclude that he had once lived this
life here on earth.</p>

<p>Thus Memory would be the arbiter of survival
and of the continuity (on the whole) of consciousness.
Frederick Myers, indeed, goes so
far as to define consciousness as that which is
“potentially memorable”<a id='r60'/><a href='#f60' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[60]</span></sup></a>—thus suggesting that
memory is a necessary accompaniment of any
psychic state to which we can venture to give the
name of consciousness.</p>

<p>It may indeed seem precarious to rest our test
of survival on so notoriously fallible, and even at
times fallacious, a thing as Memory; but one
does not see that there is anything better, or that
there is any alternative! The memory may not
be continuously enduring and operative; but if
at any future time one should be persuaded of
having survived from this present life, it must,
one would say, be by memory in some form or
other, <i>of</i> this present life. And it must be remarked
that though memory is fitful and fallible,
these epithets apply mainly to the supraliminal
memory, to that superficial memory which we
make use of by conscious effort, and which
often fails us in the moment of need. Deep
below this we dimly perceive, and daily are
becoming more persuaded of, the existence of
vast and permanent but latent stores, which from
time to time emerge into manifestation; and
more and more our psychologists are inclining
to think that the supraliminal self gains its
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_136' id='p_136'>136</a></span>
memories by tapping these stores, and that its
lapses and oblivions are more due to failure in
the tapping process than to any failure of the
memory stores themselves. Indeed not a few psychologists
are now asking whether it is not likely
that <i>every</i> psychic experience carries memory with
it, and so is preserved in the great storehouse.</p>

<p>I have already, in the last chapter, spoken of
the so-called subliminal self as, among other
things, a wonderful storehouse of memory; and I
propose now to occupy a few pages with the more
detailed consideration of the nature of that self;
because, as we are discussing the question of survival,
our discussion, as I have just said, ought
obviously to include the under as well as the
upper strata of consciousness. We cannot very
well confine our meaning and our inquiry to the
little brain-self only, and leave out of consideration
the great self of the emotions and impulses—of
genius, love, enthusiasm, and so forth.<a id='r61'/><a href='#f61' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[61]</span></sup></a> No,
we must include both—the more intimate, though
more hidden, self, as well as the self of the
façade and the front window.</p>

<p>This hidden self is indeed an astounding thing,
whose extent and complexity grows upon us as
investigation proceeds. For when the term
‘subliminal’ was first used it had apparently a
fairly simple connotation—as of some <i>one</i> obscure
and unexplored chamber of the mind; but now
instead of a single chamber it would seem rather
some vast house or palace at whose door we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_137' id='p_137'>137</a></span>
stand, with many chambers and corridors—some
dark and underground, some spacious and well
lighted and furnished, some lofty with extensive
outlook and open to the sky; and the modern
psychologists are puzzling themselves to find
suitable names for all these new domains—which
indeed they cannot satisfactorily do, seeing they
know so little of their geography!</p>

<p>I can only attempt here—very roughly I am
afraid, and unsystematically—to point out <i>some</i>
of the properties and qualities of the underlying
or hidden or subconscious self—whichever term
we may like to use. In the first place, its memory
appears to be little short of perfect, and at any
rate to our ordinary intelligence and estimate,
nothing short of marvellous. When a servant
girl, who can neither read nor write, reproduces,
in her wandering speech during a nervous fever,
whole sentences of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew,
which she could not possibly understand, and
which had only fallen quite casually on her ears
years before from the lips of an old scholar (who
used to recite passages to himself as he walked
up and down a room adjoining the kitchen in
which the girl at that time worked<a id='r62'/><a href='#f62' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[62]</span></sup></a>); we perceive
that the under or latent memory <i>may</i> catch
and retain for a lengthy period, and with strange
accuracy, the most fleeting and apparently
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_138' id='p_138'>138</a></span>
superficial impressions. When Dr. Milne Bramwell instructs
a hypnotized subject to make a cross on a
bit of paper exactly 20,180 minutes after the giving
of the order; and the patient, having of course
emerged from the hypnotic sleep, and gone about
her daily work, and having no conscious remembrance
of the command, does nevertheless
at the expiration of the stated number of days
and minutes take a piece of paper and make
the said cross upon it,<a id='r63'/><a href='#f63' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[63]</span></sup></a> we can only marvel
both at the persistence and accuracy of memory
which the subliminal being displays, and
at the strict command which this being may exercise
in its silent way over the actions of the
supraliminal self. When we are repeatedly told
that in the moment of drowning, people remember
every action and event of their past life,
though we may doubt the exact force of the word
‘every,’ we cannot but be convinced that an
enormous and astounding resurgence of memory
does take place,<a id='r64'/><a href='#f64' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[64]</span></sup></a> and we cannot but suspect that
the memorization is somehow on a different plane
of consciousness from the usual one, being simultaneous
and in mass instead of linear and successive.
Or when, again, a ‘calculating boy’ or
prodigy of quite tender years on being asked to
find the cube-root of 31,855,013 instantly says
317, or being given the number 17,861
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_139' id='p_139'>139</a></span>
immediately remarks that it consists of the factors
337 × 53,<a id='r65'/><a href='#f65' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[65]</span></sup></a> we are reduced to the alternative
suppositions, either that the boy’s subconscious
self works out these sums with a perfectly amazing
rapidity, or that it has access to stores of
memory and knowledge quite beyond the experience
of the life-time concerned. In all these
cases, and hundreds and thousands of others
which have been observed, the memory of the
subliminal self—whether manifested through
hypnotism, or in sleep or dreams, or in other
ways—seems to exceed in range and richness, as
well as in rapidity, the memory of the supraliminal
self; and indeed Myers goes so far as to
say that the deeper down one penetrates below
the supraliminal, the more perfect is the remembrance:
that, in cases where one can reach
various planes of memory in the same subject,
“it is the memory furthest from waking life
whose span is the widest, whose grasp of the
organism’s upstored impressions is the most
profound.”<a id='r66'/><a href='#f66' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[66]</span></sup></a> This is, I think, a very important
conclusion, and one to which we may recur
later.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_140' id='p_140'>140</a></span>
But the hidden being within us does not show
this extraordinary command of mental processes
merely in technical matters. Its powers extend
far deeper, into such regions as those of Genius
and Prophecy. The wonderful flashes of intuition,
the complex combinations of ideas, which
at times leap fully formed and with a kind of
authority into the field of man’s waking consciousness,
obviously proceed from a deep intelligence
of some kind, lying below, and are the
product of an immensely extended and rapid survey
of things, brought to a sudden focus. They
yield us the finest flowers of Art; and some at any
rate of the most remarkable instances of Prediction.
For though there may be—and probably
is—a purely clairvoyant prophetic gift, freed as
it were from the obscuration of Time, yet it cannot
be doubted that much or most of prophecy
is simply very swift and conclusive inference derived
from very extensive observation.</p>

<p>These flashes and inspirations are clearly not
the product of the conscious brain; they are felt
by the latter to come from beyond it. They are,
in the language of Myers, “uprushes from the
subliminal self.” And even beyond them there
are things which come from the same source—there
are splendid enthusiasms, and overwhelming
impulses of self-sacrifice, as well as mad and
dæmonic passions.</p>

<p>Yet again, it is not merely command of <i>mental</i>
processes that the subconscious being displays, but
of the bodily powers and processes too.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_141' id='p_141'>141</a></span>
Intelligent itself to the marvellous degrees already indicated,
it is evident also that its intelligence penetrates
and ordains the whole body. Every one
has heard of the <i>stigmata</i> of the Crucifixion appearing
on the hands and feet of some religious
devotee, as in the celebrated case of Louise Lateau.
Dr. Briggs of Lima once told a hypnotized
patient that “a red cross would appear on her
chest every Friday during a period of four
months”—and obediently the mark appeared.<a id='r67'/><a href='#f67' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[67]</span></sup></a>
A whisper in such cases is often sufficient; and the
latent power swiftly but effectually modifies all the
complex activities and functions of the organism
to produce the desired result. What an extraordinary
combination of elaborate intelligence and
detailed organizing power must here be at work!
And the same in the quite common yet very remarkable
cases of mental healing, with which we
are all now familiar!</p>

<p>Sometimes again—quite apart from any oral
suggestion or apparent outside influence—we find
the subjective being taking most decisive command
of a person’s faculties and actions. This happens,
for instance, in somnambulism, when the sleepwalker
perhaps passes along the narrow and perilous
ridge of a roof or wall with perfect balance
and sureness of foot—adjusting a hundred
muscles in the most delicate way, and yet with
total unconsciousness as far as the supraliminal
self is concerned. Or it happens sometimes—even
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_142' id='p_142'>142</a></span>
more remarkably—to people in full possession of
their waking faculties, at some moment when extreme
danger threatens to overwhelm them.
John Muir in his <i>The Mountains of California</i>,<a id='r68'/><a href='#f68' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[68]</span></sup></a>
describes how when scaling the very precipitous
face of a cliff he found himself completely baffled,
at a great height from the ground, and unable to
proceed either up or down. He was seized with
panic and a trembling in every limb, and was on
the point of falling, when suddenly a perfect calm
and assurance took possession of him, and somehow—he
never quite knew how—with an astonishing
agility and sure-footedness he completed
the ascent, and was saved. “I seemed suddenly to
become possessed of a new sense. The other Self—bygone
experiences, Instinct or Guardian Angel,
call it what you will—came forward and assumed
control. My trembling muscles became firm
again, every rift and flaw in the rock was seen as
through a microscope, and my limbs moved with
a positiveness and precision with which I seemed
to have nothing at all to do. Had I been borne
aloft upon wings, my deliverance could not have
been more complete.”</p>

<p>Mæterlinck, in his chapter on “The Psychology
of Accident” (in <i>Life and Flowers</i>), describes
how in the nerve-commotion of danger, Instinct,
“a rugged, brutal, naked, muscular figure,” rushes
to the rescue. “With a glance that is surer and
swifter than the onrush of the peril, it takes in
the situation, then and there unravels all its
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_143' id='p_143'>143</a></span>
details, issues and possibilities, and in a trice affords
a magnificent, an unforgettable spectacle of
strength, courage, precision, and will, in which
unconquered life flies at the throat of death.”
And similar instances—of instinctive presence of
mind, and an almost miraculous development of
faculty in extreme danger—are within the knowledge
of most people. The subliminal being steps
in quite decisively, and the ordinary conscious
mind <i>feels</i> that another power is taking over the
reins.</p>

<p>But there is another faculty of the subjacent
self which must not be passed over, and which
is very important—I mean the image-forming
power. This is one of the prime faculties of all
intelligent beings, lying at the very root of creation;
and it is a faculty possessed to an extreme
and impressive degree by the self “behind the
scenes.” I have discussed this subject generally
at some length in my book <i>The Art of Creation</i>,
and need not repeat the matter here, except to
allude to a few points. The image-forming
faculty is a natural attribute of the conscious
mind, in all perhaps but the lowest grades
of evolution; at any rate it is difficult to think
of a mind at all like ours <i>without</i> this faculty.
This faculty is most active when the mind is
withdrawn into itself, in quietude. In his study
or when burning the midnight oil the writer’s
brain teems, or is supposed to teem, with images!
But in sleep the image-forming activity is even
greater. It then shows itself in the subconscious
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_144' id='p_144'>144</a></span>
mind, in the world of dreams, whose bodiless
creations are more vivid and energetic than those
of our waking hours, and have a strange sense
of <i>reality</i> about them. But again, in the deeper
sleep of trance still more vivid images are produced.
A young student hypnotized imagines
himself to be Napoleon, then to be Garibaldi, then
to be an old woman of ninety, then to be a mere
child. He acts the parts of these characters, imitates
their handwriting, their voices, issues proclamations
to his soldiers in the name of the first
two, assumes the shaky penmanship of childhood
and of old age; and all in the course of half-an-hour
or so.<a id='r69'/><a href='#f69' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[69]</span></sup></a> The images thus formed in the deep
trance of the young man are so vivid, so powerful,
so dramatic, that they take possession of the
organism and compel it to become the means of
their manifestation. In mediumistic trance the
same thing happens. There may be suggestion
from outside, or there may not, but in the depth
of the medium’s mind images are formed which
speak and act through the entranced person,
making use in doing so of the marvellous stores
of memory and knowledge which the inner mind
has at command, and sorely puzzling the spectators
at times, as to whether the performance
is merely histrionic or whether by chance it indicates
a <i>bona fide</i> communication from the
dead.<a id='r70'/><a href='#f70' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[70]</span></sup></a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_145' id='p_145'>145</a></span>
This energetic dramatic quality of the image-forming
faculty is tremendously important. It
has not been enough insisted upon; and it has
been greatly misunderstood and misrepresented.
It is, as I say, a root-property of creation. It is
seen everywhere in the healthy activity of the human
mind, in its delight in romance and imagination,
in the play of children, the stage, literature,
art, scientific invention—the sheer joy of creation,
going on everywhere and always. Lay the conscious
and controlling and selective power of the
upper mind at rest, in the trance-condition, and
you have in the deeps of the subliminal self this
primal creative power exposed. Offer to it the
lightest suggestion, and there springs forth from
that abyss a figure corresponding, or a dozen
figures, or a whole procession! The mere delight
of creation calls them forth. Could anything be
more wonderful? What a strange glimpse it
gives us of the possibilities of Creation.</p>

<p>Some people seem to be quite shocked at the
idea that this subliminal mind, or whatever it is
that possesses these marvellous powers, should
act these parts, and lend itself to unsubstantial
and quasi-fraudulent representations. But why
accuse of deception? It is a game—the great
game we are all of us playing—the whole Creation
romancing away; with endless inexhaustible
fertility throwing out images, ideas, new shapes
and forms forever. Those forms which hold their
own, which substantiate themselves, which fill a
place, fulfil a need—they win their way into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_146' id='p_146'>146</a></span>
actual world and become the originals of the
plants, the animals, human beings, works of art,
and so forth, which we know. Those which cannot
hold their own pass back again into the unseen.
In the far depths of the entranced
medium’s mind we see this abysmal process going
on—this fountain-like production of images taking
place—the very beginnings of creation. It is the
sheer joy of manifestation. As one gives a musician
a mere hint or clue—a theme of three or
four notes—and immediately he improvises a
spirited piece of music; so is it with the hypnotized
person or with the medium. One gives him
a suggestion and he immediately creates the figures
according. And so it is for us, to direct this
wonderful power, even in ourselves—not to call it
fraudulent, but to make use of it for splendid ends.</p>

<p>Doubtless it can be used for unworthy ends.
It is easy to understand that the mediumistic person,
finding this wonderful dramatic and creative
faculty within himself or herself, is sometimes
tempted to turn it to personal advantage; and
succumbs to the temptation. The dramatic habit
catches hold of the waking self, and renders the
person tricky and unreliable.<a id='r71'/><a href='#f71' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[71]</span></sup></a> But below it all is
creation, and the instinct of creation—the power
that gives to airy nothing a local habitation, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_147' id='p_147'>147</a></span>
genius of the dramatist, of the artist, of the inventor,
and the <i>very source of the visible and
tangible world</i>.</p>

<p>For from the Under-self—as exposed in the
state of trance, or in extreme languor and exhaustion
of the body, or in the moment of death,
or in dreams, or even in profound reverie—proceed
(strange as it may seem) Voices and
Visions and Forms, things audible and visible
and tangible, things anyhow which are competent
to impress the senses of spectators so vividly
as to be for the moment indistinguishable from
the phenomena, audible, visible and tangible, of
our actual world. Amazing as are the materializations
connected with mediums—the figures
which appear, which speak, which touch and are
touched, the faces, the supernumerary feet and
hands, the sounds, the lights, the movements of
objects—all in some way connected with the
medium’s presence—these phenomena are now
far too well established and confirmed by careful
and scientific observation to admit (in the
mass) of any reasonable doubt.<a id='r72'/><a href='#f72' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[72]</span></sup></a> And similarly
with the wraiths, or phantoms which are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_148' id='p_148'>148</a></span>
projected from dying or lately dead persons, the evidence
for them in general is much too abundant
and well attested to allow of disbelief.<a id='r73'/><a href='#f73' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[73]</span></sup></a> What
an extraordinary story, for instance, is that given
by Sir Oliver Lodge in his <i>Survival of Man</i>
(p. 101)—of a workman who having drunk
poison by mistake, appeared in the moment of
death, with blue and blotched face to his employer,
to whom he was greatly attached, and told
him not to be deceived by the rumor that he
(the workman) had committed suicide! Yet the
story is fully and authoritatively given in the
<i>Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research</i>,
vol. iii. p. 97, and cannot well be set aside. But
if such things happen in the hour of death,
so do they also happen in the dream-state.<a id='r74'/><a href='#f74' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[74]</span></sup></a>
The dreamer has a vivid dream of visiting
a certain person, and is accordingly and at
that time, seen by that person. And in the
state of reverie the same. It is at times
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_149' id='p_149'>149</a></span>
sufficient to think profoundly of any one, or to
let one’s inner self go out toward that person
in order to cause an image of oneself to be seen
by him.</p>

<p>It will of course be said, and often is said,
that those phenomena are only hallucinations,
and have no objective existence. But the sufficient
answer to that is that the things also of our
actual world are hallucinations in their degree,
and certainly have no full objective existence.
The daffodil in my garden is an hallucination in
that degree that with the smallest transposition
of my senses, its color, its scent, and even its
form might be quite altered. What we call its
objectivity rests on the permanence of its relations—on
its continued appearance in one spot,
its visibility to different people at one time, or
to one person at different times, and so forth.
But if that is the definition of objectivity,
it is obvious that the forms which have been
seen over and over again, and under strict
test-conditions, in connection with certain
mediums, have had in their degree an objective
existence.</p>

<p>In America, in connection with Kate Fox (one
of the earliest and most spontaneous and natural
of modern mediums), a certain Mr. Livermore—a
thoroughly capable business man of
New York—came into communication as it
seemed with his deceased wife. She appeared
to him—not in one house only, but in several
houses—over and over again; sometimes only
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_150' id='p_150'>150</a></span>
the head, sometimes the whole figure; her appearance
was accompanied by inexplicable sounds
and lights; she communicated sometimes by
raps, sometimes by visibly writing on blank cards
brought for the purpose; and these phenomena
extended over a period of six years and 388
recorded sittings, and at many of the sittings
were corroborated by independent witnesses.<a id='r75'/><a href='#f75' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[75]</span></sup></a>
It is difficult to imagine hallucinations
or deceit maintained under such circumstances.</p>

<p>In England (in connection with the medium
Florence Cook) the figure “Katie King” appeared
to Sir William Crookes a great number of
times during three years (1881–84) and was
studied by him and Mr. C. F. Varley, F.R.S., with
the greatest scientific care. Her apparition often
spoke to those present, was touched by, and
touched them, wrote, or played with the children.
It often came outside the cabinet, and three times
was seen by those present simultaneously with,
and by the side of, the entranced medium. The
figure was taller than the medium and different in
feature; Crookes observed its pulse and found it
making 75 beats a minute to the medium’s 90,
and so forth.<a id='r76'/><a href='#f76' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[76]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Professor Richet, the French scientist, examined
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_151' id='p_151'>151</a></span>
with great care the phantasm “Beni Boa,”
which appeared to him some twenty times in connection
with the Algerian medium Aisha; he obtained
several photographs of it, and observed its
pulse, its respiration, and so forth.<a id='r77'/><a href='#f77' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[77]</span></sup></a> Lombroso,
the author of many scientific works, and a man
who to begin with was a complete sceptic on these
matters, assures us that at the sittings of Eusapia
Paladino he saw his own mother (long dead)
a great number of times, and that she repeatedly
kissed him.<a id='r78'/><a href='#f78' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[78]</span></sup></a> In connection with Mme. D’Espérance<a id='r79'/><a href='#f79' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[79]</span></sup></a>
the girlish figure of “Yolanda” appeared
and disappeared very frequently during a period
of ten years, and was well known to frequenters
of her circle; and in 1896 a committee formed
by some twenty-five high officials and well-known
persons in Norway publicly attested the repeated
appearance at her seances of a very beautiful
female figure who glided among the sitters,
grasped their hands, gave them messages, and
so forth, and disappeared before their eyes in
a misty cloud.<a id='r80'/><a href='#f80' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[80]</span></sup></a> Such evidence of the objectivity
of seance figures could be rather indefinitely
multiplied. But the same may be said, though
perhaps less conclusively, of various ghosts and
other manifestations, whose relations to certain
persons or places or houses seem quite definite
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_152' id='p_152'>152</a></span>
and well established—and not unfrequently
steadily recurrent under the same conditions.<a id='r81'/><a href='#f81' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[81]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Without going into the vexed question of
whether these and the like manifestations are
merely products or inventions of the trance-mind
of the medium or other person concerned, or
whether some at least of them are the work or
evidence of separate ‘spirits’—leaving that question
open for the present—we may still say that
all these things are actual creations—creations
of the hidden self of Man in some form or other;
not so assured, certainly, and not so permanent as
the well-known shapes of outer Nature; abortive
creations, if you like, which come a little way forward
into manifestation, and then retreat again;
but still creations in the same sense as those more
established ones; and wonderfully revealing to us
the secret of the generation and birth of all the
visible world.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>That we should have, all of us, this magic
source somewhere buried within—this Aladdin’s
lamp, this vase of the Djinns, this Pandora box
of evil as well as of good, is indeed astounding;
and must cause us, when we have once fully
realized the fact, to envisage life quite differently
from what we have ever done before. It must
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_153' id='p_153'>153</a></span>
cause us to feel that our very ordinary and daily
self—which we know so well (and which sometimes
we even get a little tired of) is only a fraction,
only a flag and a signal, of that great Presence
which we really are, that great Mass-man
who lies unexplored behind the very visible and
actual. Difficult or impossible as this being may
be to define, enormously complex as it probably
is, and far-reaching, and hard to gauge, yet we see
that it is <i>there</i>, undeniably there—a being that
apparently includes far extremes of faculty and
character, running parallel to the conscious self
from low to high levels,<a id='r82'/><a href='#f82' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[82]</span></sup></a> having in its range of
manifestation the most primitive desires and passions,
and the highest feats of intellect and enthusiasm;
and while at times capable of accepting
the most frivolous suggestions and of behaving
in a humorous or merely capricious and irresponsible
manner, at other times capable, as we
have seen, of taking most serious command and
control of the whole physical organism, and as
far as the spiritual organism is concerned, of
rising to the greatest heights of prophecy and
inspiration.<a id='r83'/><a href='#f83' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[83]</span></sup></a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_154' id='p_154'>154</a></span>
I say, then, that we must include in this problem
of survival both the ordinary upper and conscious
self and the deep-lying subjective and subconscious
(or superconscious) being. Just as the organizing
power of the Body includes the Cerebro-spinal
system of nerves on the one hand, and the Great-Sympathetic
system on the other, so the organism
of the soul includes the supraliminal and subliminal
portions. The two must be taken together,
and either alone could only represent a
fraction of the real person. The exact relation
of these two selves to each other is a matter
which can only become clear with long time and
study of this difficult subject. It may be that
the subliminal self is destined to become conscious
in our ordinary sense of the word. It may be,
on the other hand, that the conscious self is
destined to rise into the much wider consciousness
of the subjective being. There is a great deal
to suggest that the supraliminal self is only the
front as it were of the great wave of life; and
that the brain consciousness is only a very special
instrument for dealing with the surroundings and
conditions of our terrestrial existence—an instrument
which will surrender much of its value at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_155' id='p_155'>155</a></span>
death and on mergence with the larger and differently
constituted consciousness which underruns
and sustains it. That the two selves are
in constant communication with each other, and
that they are both intelligent in some sense, is
obvious from the facts of <i>suggestion</i>, by which
often the lightest whisper so to speak from the
upper is understood and attended to by the under
self; while, on the other hand, the under-self communicates
with the upper, sometimes by inner
Voices heard and Visions seen, sometimes by automatic
actions, as in dream- or trance-writing,
sometimes even by Sounds and Apparitions so
powerful as to <i>appear</i> at least external.</p>

<p>So we cannot but think that the question of survival
may ultimately resolve itself very much into
the question of the more complete and effectual
understanding between these different portions of
the self. When they come into clear relation with
each other, when the unit-man and the Mass-man
merge into a perfect understanding and
harmony, when they both become conscious of
their affiliation to the great Self of the universe,
then the problem will be solved—or we
may perhaps say, the problem will cease to
exist.</p>

<h2 id='t4892'>NOTE TO CHAPTER VIII<br/>&ensp;<br/>ON TRANCE-PHENOMENA</h2>

<p>It may seem rash or unbalanced to dwell, in the
preceding chapters, on trance and mediumistic phenomena
as much as I have done, considering that they are in
some sense abnormal—that is, they are unusual, and
comparatively few people have an opportunity of verifying
them; also they may (it is said) be abnormal in
the sense of being the products of conditions so special
or even so morbid that conclusions drawn from them
can have no general importance or value.</p>

<p>There is a certain fashion in such matters, and with
large sections of the public and during a long period it
has no doubt been the habit simply to dismiss all consideration
of this subject, as for one reason or another
unadvisable. But now these phenomena in general (or
enough of them to constitute a solid body of observation)
are so thoroughly corroborated that it would be mere
affectation to pass them by; and the best science nowadays
refuses to ignore exceptional happenings on account
of their exceptionality—recognizing that these very happenings
often afford the key to the explanation of more
common events.</p>

<p>The phenomena connected with mediums and seances
have been so amazing and unexpected that they have
often produced a kind of fear and dismay. The religious
people have been terrified at the prospect of having to
acknowledge miracles not connected with the Church;
or of having to confess to the resurrection of John Smith
as well as of Jesus Christ. The scientific folk (in many
or most quarters) being always just on the point of
completing their pet scheme of the universe—whatever
it may happen to be at the time—have naturally been
in no mood to admit new facts which would totally
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_157' id='p_157'>157</a></span>
disarrange their systems; and have, therefore, with a
few brilliant exceptions, consistently closed their eyes
or looked another way. And the general public, not
without reason, has feared to embark on a subject which
might easily float it away from the dry land of practical
life, into one knows not what sea of doubt or even
delusion.</p>

<p>But these difficulties attend at all times the introduction
of a new subject—or at least of one which is new
to the generation concerned; and can of course not be
allowed to interfere with the candid and impartial examination
of the subject, or with the assimilation, as
far as feasible, of its message. It should certainly, I
think, be admitted that there are dangers attending the
new science—or rather attending the hasty and careless
investigation of it—just as there are attending any other
science. There is no doubt that the phenomena connected
with it are so astounding that they in some
cases unhinge people’s minds, or at least for the time
upset them; and what we have already said once or
twice of the frequent bodily exhaustion of the Medium,
not to mention the occasional exhaustion of the sitters,
must convince us that the greatest care should be exercised
in connection with trance-conditions, and that the
whole subject should be studied with a view to discovering
its proper and best handling. It is clear—whatever
view is taken of the process—that a certain disintegration
of the organism, and even of the personality of the
medium, is liable to occur, one portion of the organism
acting in a manner and under influences foreign to another
portion, and that such disintegration oft repeated
or long continued may be liable to produce a permanent
degeneration of physique or even possibly demoralization
of character. If there is a danger in this direction—and
the extent of the danger should certainly be gauged—equally
certainly it ought to be minimized or averted
by the proper conditions. On the other hand, while
noting this danger, we should not leave out of mind that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_158' id='p_158'>158</a></span>
some evidence points in the other direction—namely, to
the favorable effects and influences of trance when
rightly conducted.<a id='r84'/><a href='#f84' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[84]</span></sup></a> We may also in this connection
allude to the changed attitude of the general mind to-day
toward Hypnotism—a subject allied to that which we
are considering. Fifty years ago the word had a sinister
sound, and hypnotism and mesmerism were thought to
be inventions of the devil and agencies of all evil. To-day
they are recognized as a great power for good, and
in at least two hospitals (in France) as the main instrument
of healing. Naturally, when people are ignorant
of a subject, or only in the first stages of knowledge
with regard to it, they mishandle and misunderstand it.
It may well happen therefore that with better understanding
of mediumship and trance-conditions, some of
their drawbacks or less favorable aspects may pass out
of sight.</p>

<p>Mediums and trance-phenomena—prophecy, second
sight, speaking in strange tongues, the appearance of
flames and lights, and of figures apparently from the dead—are
things that have been known all down history,
and recognized almost as a matter of course, both among
quite primitive peoples like the Kaffirs, or the Aleuts or
the Mongolians, or among the more cultured like the
Greeks, the Romans, the Hindus, Chinese, and so forth.
The Bible teems with references to wizards and “necromancers”
(note the meaning of the word); and the story
of the Witch of Endor gives us a penetrating glimpse
into what was evidently a common practice of “consultation.”
These phenomena have never been so common as
to break up and disorganize the routine of ordinary life,
yet they have always been there, and recognized, as on
the fringe or borderland—in somewhat the same way
as the knowledge or recognition of Death does not interfere
with daily life or prevent us making engagements;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_159' id='p_159'>159</a></span>
though we know it <i>may</i> do so at any time. And beyond
any direct uses that trance-communication and manifestations
may have now, or may have had in the past (a
matter on which no doubt there is a good deal of difference
of opinion), we may fairly suppose that as examples
of real things and of a real world lying just
outside the sphere of our ordinary and actual experience
they may be of immense value—both as delivering us
from a cramped and petty belief that we have already
fathomed the possibilities of the universe, and as giving
us just a hint and a glimpse of directions in which we
may fairly look for the future. That we should for the
present be limited for the most part to a definite sphere
of activity, or to a definite region of creation, seems only
natural. “One world, please, at a time!” said Thoreau
when on his deathbed he was plagued by some pious
person about the future life; and if <i>we</i> in our daily
life were entangled in the manifestations of two very
different planes of existence it might be greatly baffling.
At the same time, the occasional hint or message from
another plane may be of the greatest help.</p>

<p>Condensations and manifestations (as of beings from
such other plane) may be abnormal at present. They
may be rare, they may occur under unexpected and even
unhealthy conditions, they may cause dislocations of
mind and of morals, they may be confused and confusing.
All these things we should indeed in some degree
<i>expect</i>; and yet it may not follow that these objections
will continue. It is quite possible that in the future they
will disappear. As I have had occasion to say many
times, every new movement or manifestation of human
activity, when unfamiliar to people’s minds, is sure to be
misrepresented and misunderstood. It appears in humble
guise, without backing or patronage, forcing its way to
light in the most unlikely places, “to the Jews a stumbling-block,
to the Greeks foolishness,” often distorted
and out of shape owing to its very birth-struggles, and
for the very same reason diffident at first and uncertain
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_160' id='p_160'>160</a></span>
of its own mission. Possibly a time is coming when
Mediumship, instead of being left over (as not unfrequently
now) to quite ignorant and uncultured specimens
of humanity, and being exercised in haphazard,
careless fashion, or for monetary gain, or personal vanity,
will be looked upon as a sacred and responsible
office, worthy of and requiring considerable preparation
and instruction, demanding the respect of the public,
yet thoroughly criticized, both in method and result, by
intelligent examination and logic. Possibly a time is
coming when messages and manifestations from another
plane than that of our daily life will come to us under
the most obviously healthy and sane conditions, and will
be fully recognized as having value and even, in their
way, authority.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>For the present—allowing (as I do) the absolute
genuineness of a great body of “spiritualistic” phenomena—there
still is (owing to various causes already indicated)
considerable doubt as to <i>who</i> or <i>what</i> the manifesting
beings or forces are. I suppose the main theories
on the subject may be gathered under the following
heads: that the manifesting powers are (1) Images,
more or less unconsciously projected from the Medium’s
own mind; or, in case of raps, and so forth, emissions of
force from the medium’s body; (2) that they are the
same projected from the minds or bodies of other persons
present; (3) that they are independent Beings,
making <i>use</i> of the medium’s or other person’s organism
for the purpose of expression; or (4) that there is a
blending of these actions.</p>

<p>I think everyone who has studied the matter practically
admits the first explanation in some degree; most people
perhaps allow the second and fourth; but a good many—though
not all—exclude the third. With regard, however,
to this last theory (that there really are occasional
messages or manifestations from the dead—or from “the
other side”) there certainly seems to be a very
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_161' id='p_161'>161</a></span>
considerable residuum of evidence which, though not absolutely
conclusive, is favorable to it; and there certainly are a
considerable number of eminent and responsible men—like
Myers, Lodge, Lombroso, and others—who, though
not dogmatic, profess themselves inclined to accept the
theory, on the evidence so far available. For myself—having
so little personal and direct experience in this
field—I do not feel in a position to form a definite
opinion, and am content to leave the evidence to accumulate.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_162' id='p_162'>162</a></span>
<h1 id='t5096'>CHAPTER IX<br/>&ensp;<br/>SURVIVAL OF THE SELF</h1>

<p><span class='sc'>In</span> the last chapter we pointed out that for any
adequate understanding of the subject before us
the self must be taken to include the more obscure
and subconscious portion of the mind, as
well as the specially conscious portion with which
we are most familiar. There is a constant
interaction and flow taking place between the
two parts, and to draw a strict line dividing
them would be impossible. Indeed it would
rather appear that growth comes largely by their
blending and throwing light on each other. We
also brought forward some considerations to
show the nature of the underlying or subconscious
self—its immense extent, the swiftness
of its perceptions, and so forth. If then, to continue
our argument, there should come a time (in
death) when the outer and more obvious ego
merges, or at least comes into closer relation,
with the under-self, it would seem likely that
the surviving consciousness would be greatly
changed from its present form, and would take on
something of the instantaneous wide-reaching
character of what has been called the Cosmic
Consciousness. And this is a conclusion much
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_163' id='p_163'>163</a></span>
to be expected, and surely also much to be
desired. However one may envisage the matter,
it hardly seems possible to imagine an after-death
consciousness quite on the same plane as
our present consciousness. (This, too—one may
say in passing—probably explains the difficulty
we experience in holding direct communication
with the dead—the same sort of difficulty, in fact,
that the outer mind during life has in directly
reaching the inner mind.) Myers<a id='r85'/><a href='#f85' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[85]</span></sup></a> speaks of our
supraliminal life as merely a special phase of our
whole personality, and suggests that there are
good reasons for thinking that there is a relation—“obscure
but indisputable—between the
subliminal and the surviving self.” Under these
circumstances it would seem natural to inquire
what definite reasons there may be for
thinking that the subliminal self survives; and
I shall occupy this chapter largely with that
question.</p>

<p>(1) In the first place, from the observed process
of the generation and growth of the body
from a microscopic origin, we have already
argued (chapter vii.) the probability of the pre-existence
in a sub-atomic or fourth-dimensional
state of the being which is manifested in the body,
and therefore the probability of the continuance
of that being after the dissolution of the body.
And this argument must include the Under-self,
which is responsible for so much of the
organization and growth and sustentation of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_164' id='p_164'>164</a></span>
body, as well as the Upper; and may well
lead us to infer that both upper and under selves
continue after death—only conjoined in some
way, and with some added experience gained during
life.</p>

<p>(2) In the second place, we are struck by the
fact that continuous Memory—which we decided
to be the very necessary condition of survival—is
just the thing which is so strong in the subjective
being and so characteristic of it. The huge stores
of memory—and of quite <i>personal and individual</i>
memory—which this being has at command, their
long dormancy and their extraordinary resurgence
at times when conditions call them forth, are a
marvel to the investigator, and make us feel that
it is hardly probable that they are all swept away
at death. Even if dormant <i>at</i> the time of
death, it seems not unlikely that here again
later conditions may awake them once more to
life.</p>

<p>But (3), we have a great deal of evidence to
show that, as a matter of fact, the underlying
self is especially <i>active</i> at the moment of death.
The whole phenomenon of ‘wraiths’—now in the
mass so amply proved<a id='r86'/><a href='#f86' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[86]</span></sup></a>—the projection of phantasms
sometimes to an immense distance,<a id='r87'/><a href='#f87' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[87]</span></sup></a> by persons
<i>in articulo mortis</i>—goes to show its intense
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_165' id='p_165'>165</a></span>
energy and <i>vitality</i> (if one may use the word) at
that moment. And the vivid resurgences of memory
at the same moment (or in any hour of danger)
point in the same direction. T. J. Hudson,
and others, insist that the subjective mind <i>never
sleeps</i>—that whatever drowsiness, or faintness, or
languor may overpower the upper or self-conscious
mind, the under mind is still acutely
awake and operant, and if this is (as it appears)
true with regard to sleep, it may well also be so
even with regard to death.</p>

<p>Again (4), the Telæsthetic faculty of the
under-self (I mean during life)—its power of
clairvoyantly perceiving things and events at a
distance, even in minutest details—is a very
wonderful fact—a fact that is amply established,
and one that must give us pause. Here are
vision and perception at work without eyes or
ears, or any of the usual bodily end-organs<a id='r88'/><a href='#f88' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[88]</span></sup></a>—and
acting in such a way as to suggest or practically
to prove that the soul has other channels
or instruments of perception than those connected
with the well-known outer body. Every one has
heard of cases of this kind. They are common
on the borderland of sleep, or in dreams, and—what
especially appeals to us here—they are very
common in the hour of death. If the soul (as
is evidently the case) can perceive without the
intermediation of mortal eye or ear; then—though
we may conclude that these special organs
have been fashioned or developed for special
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_166' id='p_166'>166</a></span>
terrene use—we may also conclude that, without
them, it would still continue to exercise perception,
developing sight and hearing and other
faculties along lines with which at present we are
but slightly acquainted. These faculties spring
inevitably deep down out of ourselves, and will
recur again doubtless wherever we are....
“Were your eyes destroyed, still the faculty of
sight were not destroyed; out of the same roots
again as before would another optic apparatus
spring.”<a id='r89'/><a href='#f89' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[89]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>And the same may be said, (5), about the telepathic
faculty—that is, the power (not of perceiving,
but) of <i>sending</i> impressions or messages
to a distance. This power which the under-self
has of communicating with the under-selves of
other persons, and often at a great distance, is
one of the best-established facts in the new
psychology; and again, it is very pregnant with
inference. It shows us the soul acting vividly
along certain lines independent as far as we can
see of the known body, certainly along lines independent
of the known organs of expression.
It compels us to conclude a possible and even
probable activity quite apart from that body.
With this telepathic power, or as an extension of
it, may be classed the image-projecting faculty,
which we have already seen to be peculiarly
active in death. And it may be appropriate here
to notice that in quite a number of the cases of
wraiths or phantasms projected (in forty cases
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_167' id='p_167'>167</a></span>
out of three hundred and sixteen as given by
Edmund Gurney in <i>Proceedings S.P.R.</i> vol. v.
p. 408) the apparition was seen after the death
had occurred—though within twenty-four hours
after. This may directly indicate an after-death
activity of the person who projected the image,
or it <i>may</i> merely indicate a relay of the telepathic
impression on its way, or in the subconscious
mind of the recipient, previous to emerging in
the latter’s <i>conscious</i> mind.<a id='r90'/><a href='#f90' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[90]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>All these things are strongly indicative. They
do not give the impression that at death the
underlying self is in the act of perishing. On
the contrary, they point to its continuance, and
if anything <i>increased</i> activity; while at the same
time the strongly <i>personal</i> character of many of
the phenomena referred to—the wonderfully distinct
personal memories, the very personal images
or phantasms projected, the telepathic appeal to
nearest and dearest friends—all suggest that the
continuing activity does not merely tail off into
an abstract life-force or vague stream of tendency,
but is of a distinctly personal or individual character.</p>

<p>There is another consideration, (6), on which
I may dwell for a moment here. The passion of
Love, whether considered in its physical or in its
psychical and emotional aspects, is notably
a matter of the subjective or subliminal life.
The little self-conscious, logical, argumentative
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_168' id='p_168'>168</a></span>
personality is completely routed by this passion,
which seems to spring from the great depths of
being with Titanic force, full-armed in its own
convictions, and overturning all established orders
and conventions. It surely must give us a
deep insight into the nature of that hidden self
from which it springs. Yet nothing is more noticeable
about the passion than its recklessness of
mortal life—nothing more noticeable than its willingness
to sacrifice all worldly prospects and the
body itself in the pursuit of its ends. Even the
most physical love, as we have said already
(chapter vi.), has a strange relation to Death,
and often slays the very object of its desire:—</p>

<div class='poetry-container'><div class='lgp'>
<p class='line0'>“For each man kills the thing he loves,</p>
<p class='line0'>Though each man does not die.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>While the more emotional form of the passion
almost rejoices in its contempt of life and its
willingness to face dangers and death for the sake
of the beloved. It says as plain as words:—“I
can fulfil myself and my purposes all right, even
without this mortal part which you hold so dear”;
and unless we think that the hidden being who
thus speaks is a perfect fool, we must conclude
that it is <i>aware</i> of a life surpassing that of the
body.</p>

<p>Such a continuing life we no doubt have evidence
of, and indeed commonly admit to exist, in
the Race-life; and as a first approximation it
seems natural and obvious to interpret the underlying
or subliminal self as being simply the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_169' id='p_169'>169</a></span>
Race-self. In the case of the lower and less developed
forms of creation, perhaps this is the wisest thing
to do. In default of more detailed and perfect
knowledge, we may easily assume that in a shoal
of several million herrings or in a ‘culture’ of
several billion microbes the underlying self of
each particular herring or microbe is practically
identical with the self of the race concerned.
But in the case of man and some of the higher
animals it is not so easy to do this. We find a
strongly individual element in his subconscious
mind, which must also be accounted for. I have
already alluded to the stores of individual memory
which this mind retains, thus differentiating it
from others; and I have alluded to the intensely
individual phantasms which it projects. And now
again we are brought face to face with the greatly
individual character of its love-passion. However
much the love-passion may be symbolical
of the life of the race, and deeply implicated in
the same (and both of these it certainly is), still—except
in its lower forms—there is nothing
vague and general and undifferentiated about that
passion; on the contrary, it is most strongly personal
and sharply outlined. Why is it that out
of the hundred thousand people that a man may
meet only <i>one</i> will arouse this tremendous response?
Why is it that every great love in its
depth seems different from every other? Do
not these things suggest a profound difference
of outline in the subconscious beings themselves
from whom these loves proceed? These
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_170' id='p_170'>170</a></span>
beings are manifestations and organic expressions
of the Race—yes. But they are also
deeply individual and different—each one from
the other.</p>

<p>And here we seem to come upon the first
emergence of the solution of the problem before
us. The self of which we are in search <i>has</i>—especially
through its subconscious part—a vast
continuing life, affiliated to the life of the race
and beyond that to the cosmic life of the All;
but it also has a strongly individual outline and
character. Nursed in the womb of the Race
during countless ages, like a babe within its
mother, passing through numberless reincarnations
in a kind of collective way, and in more or
less unconsciousness of its supreme and separate
destiny, it at last in Man attains to the clear sense
of individuality, and (through much suffering) is
set free to an independent existence; being finally
exhaled from earth-mortality into a cosmic life
under other conditions of space and time than
ours.</p>

<p>Difficult as this conception of a continued
individual existence may be to hold to in
view of the terrible and external flux of general
Nature, and difficult as it may be to understand
in all detail; yet, as I say, it is Love which
compels us to the insight of its truth. It is Love
which has the clear conception of the uniqueness
of the beloved, it is love which positively
refuses to believe in her (or his) annihilation,
it is love alone which in the hour of loss can
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_171' id='p_171'>171</a></span>
face the awful midnight sky, and dare to
sing:—</p>

<div class='poetry-container'><div class='lgp'>
<p class='line0'>“Sleep sweetly, tender heart, in peace,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Sleep, holy Spirit, blessed soul!</p>
<p class='line0'><i>While the stars burn, the moons increase,</i></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<i>And the great ages onward roll.</i>”</p>
</div></div>

<p>And it is in the meeting of lovers that the heavens
open, allowing them to see—if only for a moment—the
eternities to which they both belong.</p>

<p>There are no doubt other considerations—I
mean those connected with mediumistic and so-called
spiritualistic phenomena—which point toward
the conclusion of an individual survival of
some kind after death; but although this kind of
evidence is likely to prove in the end of immense
value, it is possible that the time has not
yet quite come when it can be completely substantiated,
tabulated, and effectively utilized; at
any rate I do not feel myself in a position to so
deal with it. It has also to be said that a great
deal of this evidence (relating to actual communications
from the dead) is necessarily of so very
personal a character that it can only appeal to the
individual persons concerned, and however convincing
it may be to them does naturally not
carry the same conviction to the world at large.
I shall therefore for the present pass these considerations
by, and, on the strength of the arguments
already brought forward, assume the general
truth of man’s survival.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_172' id='p_172'>172</a></span>
The course of the argument has been somewhat
as follows. In the first place, we have
urged the enormous possibilities (disclosed by
modern investigation) of other life than that
which we know—thus enlarging the bounds of
the likely, and weakening the argument from
improbability. In the second place, we have
pointed out that continuance of <i>memory</i> seems the
best test of survival; that even in our law courts
(as in a Tichborne case) it is not so much the
facts of feature and form as the facts of memory
which are relied on to prove identity. Thirdly,
we have argued that not only the supraliminal
but also the subliminal self must be considered in
this matter, and that probably the surviving self
will arise from a harmony or conjunction between
these two. Fourthly, we have shown that in
respect of memory and many other matters the
subliminal self shows a quite remarkable activity
even in the hour of bodily death—which does not
certainly suggest its decease and cessation from
existence. Fifthly, we have seen that all through
life the soul has faculties (of clairvoyance, transposition
of senses, and so forth) which
point to its independence of the material body.
Sixthly, that through <i>love</i> it reaches a deep
conviction of its own duration beyond the life
of the body. And, seventhly, we have suggested
that it is largely through the supraliminal and
self-conscious life that the sense of identity
and individuality is educed and finally established.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_173' id='p_173'>173</a></span>
Proceeding, then, further along these lines, the
next and obvious question which arises is, In
what sort of body is this continuing life manifested?
That it must be manifested in some
sort of body is, I think, clear. If we had only
arrived at the conclusion that at death the human
being merged in the All-soul, or became
an indistinguishable portion of the ‘Happy
Mass’—that his individual memory flowed out
into the great ocean of the world-memory and
became lost in it, and that his power of individual
action or perception passed away in
like manner—why then the question of a
continuing body could not well arise, or at
farthest stretch such body could only be thought
of as something indistinguishable from the
entire universe. But if there is any truth in
the idea of an individual survival, then it
seems clear that there must be some kind of
<i>form</i>, to mark the bounds of the individual,
and to give outline to his relations to other
individuals—whether those relations be active
and invasive or passive and receptive; there
must be some surface of resistance and separation.</p>

<p>With this question I shall deal in the next
chapter. Before, however, going into any definite
theory of this ‘soul-body,’ it may be useful
to dwell for a moment on general considerations.
In the first place, it is clear that if
the individual survives, he does not do so in
any fixed and unchanging form. The form of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_174' id='p_174'>174</a></span>
the individual is not fixed in this earth-life; nor
can we expect or wish it to be so in any
other life. As long as there is a continuous
stream of experience and memory, going on from
this life to another life, and from that perchance
to others—that is all we can expect to find. There
may, indeed, be a fixed and transcendent Individuality,
an aspect of the Universal, at the root
of all these experiences, but with that we are
hardly concerned at this moment—only with the
stream of personal manifestations which proceed
from it—everchanging yet linked together from
hour to hour. In the second place, though we
have dwelt upon and emphasized the idea of
separateness and differentiation, in the surviving
self, in contra-distinction to the idea of fusion
in a formless aggregate, yet it is clear here too
that the common life and bonds must hold individuals
together, just as much as, if not
more than, in the earth-life. The salient facts
of telepathy, sympathy, clairvoyance, and so
forth convince us that souls, freed to some
extent from their grosser present envelopes,
will react upon each other in the future, or
in that farther world, more swiftly and more
intimately than they do now. And as they
progress from stage to stage, developing individualities
and differences always on a grander
and grander scale, so they will also develop
through love their organic union with each
other. It seems possible, indeed, that growth
will largely take place <i>through</i> love-fusion; till
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_175' id='p_175'>175</a></span>
at length, rising into the highest ranges of
combined Individuality and Universality, the
transformed consciousness of each soul will take
on its true quality—“that of space itself—which
is at rest everywhere.”</p>

<h1 id='t5525'>CHAPTER X<br/>&ensp;<br/>THE INNER OR SPIRITUAL BODY</h1>

<p><span class='sc'>In</span> order to form a conception of what kind of
body the surviving Self may have, it seems best
for the moment to go back to the genesis of
our present body. We saw (chapter vii.) that
we were compelled to suppose, even in the first
germ of our actual body an intelligent form
of some kind at work, which while gathering
up and representing race-memories of the past,
presided over and directed their rehabilitation in
the present, thus building up the present body
according to a certain pattern—(though subject
of course to modification by outer difficulties
and obstacles). From the very first, the exceeding
complexity and delicacy of the movements
within the germ-cells, combined with the decisiveness
of their divisions and differentiations, and
the perfection and adaptation of the bodily
structures and organs ultimately produced, all
point in the suggested direction.<a id='r91'/><a href='#f91' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[91]</span></sup></a> At the same
time, we were compelled to conclude that this
form, whose first manifestations in the tiny germ-cell
evidently originate from quite ultra-microscopic
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_177' id='p_177'>177</a></span>
movements, was itself invisible, invisible
through belonging either to an ultra-microscopic
world, or to a world of a fourth-dimensional or
other order of existence. I think, therefore, that
for the present we may accept that conclusion, and
fairly suppose that some such invisible form underlies
the genesis of each of our bodies.</p>

<p>But at the same time the conclusion of invisibility
must not be supposed to carry with it
the conclusion of immateriality. Quite the contrary.
A creature living in the two-dimensional
world formed by the water-film on the surface
of a pond might have no conception of the
water-world below or the air-world above—both
of which might be quite invisible to it; all
the same a fish or a bird breaking through the
surface would instantly cause some very powerful
and very material phenomena there! And again,
though atoms and electrons individually may
be quite invisible, it is only a question of their
number and the force of their electric charges,
as to how far they intrude upon what we call
the material world. Also, we must remember
that invisibility or imperceptibility does not by
any means imply non-occupation of space. On
the contrary again. For four-dimensional existence
carries with it an occupation of space which
is quite miraculous to us—as, for instance, the
power of appearing in two places at the same
time; while a number of ultra-microscopic atoms,
by their electrostatic attractions and repulsions,
may maintain definite relations of distance from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_178' id='p_178'>178</a></span>
each other, and may altogether constitute a cloud
of considerable size and complex organization—quite
imperceptible as a rule, yet occupying a
definite area and fully capable of affecting material
things.</p>

<p>It may be a question, then, whether it is not
some such invisible cloud—perhaps of quite
human size and measurement—which at conception
begins to enter the fertilized germ-cell,
stimulating it to division, and penetrating further
and further into the newly-formed body-cells,
as by thousands and millions they divide and
multiply to form the growing organism. Whatever
it is, it is something of infinitely subtle
organization and constitution, representing the
inmost vitality of the body, and not that inmost
vitality in a merely general sense, but the vitality
of every portion and section of the body. It
establishes itself within the gross body (or it
builds that body round itself) and becomes the
organizer and provider of its life; maintains its
form and structure during life, fortifies it against
change and disease, and wards off as long as it
can the arrival of death.</p>

<p>What, then, of Death? Why, granted so much
as we have supposed, it seems easy to suppose
that at death this inner body passes away again.
It just leaves the gross body behind and passes
out of it. For a fourth-dimensional being this
must be easy to do! But not to presume too
much on other-dimensional conditions, if we only
assume the inner body to be such a cloud of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_179' id='p_179'>179</a></span>
atoms or electrons as already mentioned, the
passage of such atoms through the tissues of the
gross body would be entirely in accordance with
the well-known facts of <i>osmose</i> and the diffusion
of liquids and gases, and would present no exceptional
or impossible problem. Through cell-walls
and muscular and other tissues such atoms
would pass, conceivably maintaining still their
relative ‘form’ and organization with regard to
each other, and forming a cloud similar to that
which entered the germ and other cells at conception
(though of course so far modified by
the life-experience), and leaving now the gross
body devitalized, and doomed to slow corruption
and to serve only as material for lower
forms.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>One would not, of course, venture on conjectures
so speculative as the above, if it were
not that long tradition and history, and even
modern experience, so singularly confirm or favor
their general truth. The conception of a cloud-like
ghost—sometimes visible, sometimes invisible<a id='r92'/><a href='#f92' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[92]</span></sup></a>—leaving
the body at death, roaming
through the fields of Hades or some hidden world,
and from time to time revisiting the glimpses of
the moon and the gaze of wondering mortals—penetrates
all literature and tradition. Among
all primitive peoples it seems to be accepted
as a matter of course; it informs the legends
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_180' id='p_180'>180</a></span>
and the drama and the philosophies of the more
cultivated; it claims detailed historical instances
and proofs<a id='r93'/><a href='#f93' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[93]</span></sup></a> (as in the case of Field-marshal von
Grumbkoff, to whom the wraith of King Frederick
Augustus announced his own death—which had
just occurred; or in the case of the poet Petrarch,
to whom Bishop Colonna made a similar announcement);
and in modern times it has met
with extraordinary and in many quarters quite
unexpected confirmation at the hands of scientific
investigation.</p>

<p>To this evidence of general probability that
at death a vital and subtle yet substantial inner
body is withdrawn from every part and portion
of the gross body, we may add the evidence, such
as it is, from actual <i>sensation</i> and <i>experience</i>. In
the hour of death and in allied physical
changes sensations are experienced corresponding
to such a conclusion. Though necessarily there
is little quite direct evidence, for the actual
moment of death, yet in the just preceding stage,
of extreme weakness, the sensation of depletion
in every part of the body, and of withdrawal,
as of a hand being drawn out of a glove, is very
noticeable. (And it may be remarked that clairvoyants
not unfrequently observe, at death itself,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_181' id='p_181'>181</a></span>
a luminous cloud of the general outline and
shape of the dying person being slowly distilled,
head first, from his or her head.) Furthermore,
in the state of <i>ecstasy</i>—which is closely allied
to death—the same sensation of withdrawal is
experienced. The person seems to himself to
stand outside and a little beyond his own body—and
doubtless this experience is denoted in the
very etymology of the word. In trance the
same: the medium experiences the extreme of
exhaustion while some portion of her vital
being is functioning (as it appears) outside.
Under anæsthetics it is a common experience to
dream that one has left the body and is flying
through space. (See <i>The Art of Creation</i>, p. 18.)
And again, in the case of love—whose close
relation to death we have several times already
noted—whether it be in the strain of emotional
desire or the stress of the physical orgasm
this ‘hand from the glove’ sensation is often
most acute and seems to suggest that every
portion of the body is contributing its part to
the process in hand; which indeed in this case
of love may very fairly be supposed to consist
in a transfer of the cloud-like organism
(or a large part of it) to the other person concerned.</p>

<p>There are cases, too, where in a kind of dream-consciousness
the sensation of the self passing
out through walls and other obstacles is so
powerful as to leave an impress on the mind
ever after. Such is the case already alluded to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_182' id='p_182'>182</a></span>
(chapter viii. p. 148, <i>supra</i>) from <i>Footfalls on the
Boundary of Another World</i>, where a lady half
waking from sleep “felt herself carried to the
wall of her room, with a feeling that it must
arrest her further progress. But no; she seemed
to pass through it into the open air. Outside
the house was a tree; and this also she appeared
to traverse as if it interposed no obstacle.” She
thus passed to the house of a lady friend, held
a conversation with her, and in her dream
returned. But afterward the friend reported
that she had <i>seen</i> the apparition that night and
conversed with it. Similarly a young friend of
mine, dreaming one night that his mother (in
the same house) was ill, was intensely conscious
of dashing—not along corridors and through
doorways but <i>through the partition walls of two
rooms</i>—into the chamber where his mother slept,
when finding her all right he returned; and the
experience was so vivid that it remained with
him for days afterward.</p>

<p>Taking all these considerations together, we
may say that there is a strong general probability
in favor of the proposition put forward. And it
is interesting and important to find that at this
juncture modern science is coming out from her
old haunts and beginning seriously to tackle a
question which she has hitherto for the most
part evaded or ignored. The whole of the psychology
and even physiology of Death have (as
I have previously remarked) been sadly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_183' id='p_183'>183</a></span>
neglected; but now and of late quite a number of
books on this subject have been published,<a id='r94'/><a href='#f94' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[94]</span></sup></a> and
a good deal of scientific activity is moving in that
direction.</p>

<p>Professor Fournier d’Albe, in his book <i>New
Light on Immortality</i>,<a id='r95'/><a href='#f95' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[95]</span></sup></a> has made some very interesting
suggestions—which though they may not
as yet be accounted more than suggestions, seem
to be in the right direction, and certainly acquire
some authority from his intimate command of
the modern discoveries in Physics as well as
in the field of Psychical Research. His view
is that every one of the twenty-five thousand
million million cells which constitute say the
human body has probably some ‘centrosome’ or
other vital point within it, which is in fact the
governing and organizing power of that cell. Such
point or collection of points, though ‘material,’
may likely weigh only a ten-thousandth part of the
cell-weight. Hence if this ‘soul’ was abstracted
from each cell, the total weight of the twenty-five
thousand billion souls resulting would be only a
ten-thousandth part of the body weight, or about
a fifth of an ounce! But these soul-fragments
or <i>psychomeres</i> as he calls them, would together
make up the total soul of the man, and—as already
explained—might not only by their negative
and positive charges maintain certain spatial
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_184' id='p_184'>184</a></span>
relations and organization with regard to each
other, but would, owing to their extreme minuteness,
easily pass through the tissues and liberate
themselves from the gross body. Thus a human
soul, weighing a fraction only of an ounce, but of
like shape and size to the human body, and of
intense vitality and subtlety, might disengage
itself at death, to begin a fresh career and to
enter into a new life—leaving the existing body
to fall to ruin and decay. Further, Professor
Fournier d’Albe, greatly bold in speculation, surmises
that such a spiritual body, discharging the
atmosphere from its interior frame, might quite
naturally rise in the air till it attained its position
of equilibrium at a great height up—say in a
region 35–80 miles over the earth, which would
thus become the (first) abode of the departed.</p>

<p>Whatever may be said about the details of
this theory, and whatever difficulties they may
present, the main outlines—as I have already
indicated—seem quite feasible and probable, and
in line with world-old belief and tradition. And
certain details (which we shall return to again)
are powerfully corroborated by modern observation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it is interesting to find, in corroboration
of the general theory, that some experiments
lately carried out, in weighing the body
before and after death, have apparently
yielded the result of a decided loss of weight at
or very shortly after, the moment of Death.
Dr. Duncan M‘Dougall, experimenting with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_185' id='p_185'>185</a></span>
considerable care, found that one of his patients
lost ¾ ounce precisely at death;<a id='r96'/><a href='#f96' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[96]</span></sup></a> another lost ½
ounce, with an additional loss of 1 ounce
during the next few minutes, after which no
further loss took place; another yielded very
nearly the same result; and so on. Thus we have
the old Egyptian idea of the weighing of the soul
after death resuscitated in a very practical form in
modern times—only with the medical practitioner
in the place of Thoth, the great assessor of the
Underworld! And it would be satisfactory to
know how far modern observation of a normal
soul weight corresponds with ancient speculation
in the matter. It is curious anyhow to
find that Fournier d’Albe’s estimates are so
nearly corroborated by Dr. M‘Dougall; and we
must await with interest further and perhaps
more detailed observations along the same
line.</p>

<p>Another line along which something seems to
have been done by hard and fast science to corroborate
the general theory of the extrusion of
a cloud-like spirit form from the body at death,
is in the matter of photography. Dr. Baraduc,
in his book, <i>Mes Morts: leurs manifestations</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_186' id='p_186'>186</a></span>
(1908), gives an account of photographs which
he took of his wife’s body within an hour after
death and of his son’s body (in the coffin) nine
hours after death. When developed the plates all
showed cloud-like emanations hovering over the
corpses, not certainly having definite human outline,
but apparently shot through by lines and
streaks of light. And though here again the experiments
are not conclusive, they so far are corroborative,
and may be taken to indicate a direction
for further inquiry.</p>

<p>This last I think we are especially entitled to
say, on account of what has been already done in
the way of photographing the cloud-figures (some
of them very definite in outline) which are found
to emanate on occasions from mediums in the
state of trance. For notwithstanding the doubt
which has commonly been cast on all such photographs
and notwithstanding the very obvious ease
with which cameras can be manipulated and
shadow-figures of some kind fraudulently produced,
the evidence for the genuineness of some
such ‘spirit’ photographs is—to any one who
really studies it—beyond question. The celebrated
“Katie King,” who appeared at seances in
connection with the medium Florence Cook, and
during a period of two years or more was seen by
some hundreds of people—and especially studied
by Sir William Crookes—was photographed
several times under test conditions.<a id='r97'/><a href='#f97' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[97]</span></sup></a> Professor
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_187' id='p_187'>187</a></span>
Charles Richet, who when he first heard of
Crookes’ conclusions was convulsed with laughter
over their supposed absurdity, afterward confessed
his error,<a id='r98'/><a href='#f98' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[98]</span></sup></a> for time after time he not only
saw a phantasm (“Beni Boa”) in connection with
the Algerian medium Aisha, but obtained
photographs of the same.<a id='r99'/><a href='#f99' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[99]</span></sup></a> Dr. A. R. Wallace,
in a long note, pp. 190, 191 of his book, <i>Miracles
and Modern Spiritualism</i>, gives a careful description
of his own experiments in this line. Several
different figures were at different times photographed
in connection with Mme. D’Espérance;
and the very detailed account, with illustrations,
which she gives of these phenomena in ch. xxvii.
of her book, <i>Shadowland</i>, must give the unbeliever
pause. And so on.<a id='r100'/><a href='#f100' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[100]</span></sup></a> The evidence is so
abundant, and so on the whole so well confirmed,
that we are practically now compelled to admit
(and this is the point in hand) that cloud-like
forms of human outline emanating from a
medium’s or other person’s living body may
at times be caught by the photographic plate.
And this is important because it removes the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_188' id='p_188'>188</a></span>
phenomenon from the region of the fanciful or
imaginative and gives it automatic and objective
registration.</p>

<p>That these forms occurring and occasionally
photographed in connection with mediums are
independent ‘spirits’ or souls is of course in no
way assumed. They may be such, or (what
seems more likely) they may be simply extensions
of the spiritual or inner body of the medium.
The point that interests us here is that their appearance
in either case points to the actual existence
of such an inner body, capable of becoming
extruded from the gross body, and of becoming
the seat and manifestation of intelligence.
Further than that we need not go at present.</p>

<p>But it will be objected, if the inner or spiritual
body is, as has just been supposed, of such a subtle
and tenuous nature as to be in itself quite invisible,
what connection can this have with phantoms
that can be photographed, or that can be seen, or
that can be actually touched and handled? This
question—the question as to how an excessively
rare and tenuous and invisible being may gradually
condense and materialize so as to come first
within the region of photographic activity, and
then within the region of normal visibility, and
so on into audible and tangible and material
existence and operation, I shall discuss more at
length in the next chapter. Suffice it here to point
out that the general consensus of thoughtful
opinion on this subject at the present time points
to a probable condensation of some kind, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_189' id='p_189'>189</a></span>
utilization of such suitable materials as may be to
hand, by which the subtle inner body gradually
clothes itself in an outer and denser garment.
Whether with Fournier d’Albe we suppose a soul-like
core to every single cell, or whether we take
a more diffused and general view, in any case we
seem compelled to believe that our actual bodies
are carried on by organizing powers distributed
in centres throughout the body.<a id='r101'/><a href='#f101' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[101]</span></sup></a> If by any means
these vital centres were separated from the gross
body, it would still seem natural for them to continue
their organizing activity whenever they were
surrounded with suitable material. And if, as
seems likely, in the case of mediums and seances,
a considerable quantity of loose floating organic
material is commonly evolved from the bodies
of those present, such effluences might be quickly
caught up and condensed by any such vital
centres present into more or less visible forms
and figures.</p>

<p>If, by way of illustration, we were to suppose
an army-corps to represent a gross body, then
the officers, from corporals to general, would
represent the inner or organizing soul; and all
these officers together, though really being a
‘body,’ would constitute a mass so small and so
scattered compared with the mass-body of the
army, that in comparison they would be invisible,
and might easily all pass out and away from the
army without being observed. They might pass
out and conceivably organize another army-corps
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_190' id='p_190'>190</a></span>
elsewhere; but the result on that left behind (of
which they were really the soul) would soon be
seen in its complete disintegration and collapse.
Now suppose further that in a neighboring nation,
across the frontier, there was a great deal of
disaffection existing—that large masses of the
people there were out of touch with their own
Government (the case of a medium in trance),
and waiting for some one to come and organize
them. Then it is easy to imagine the small group
of officers aforesaid passing across the frontier
(quite unseen and unobserved) and immediately
on doing so finding ready to their hands a quantity
of material just suitable for their activity. In
a wonderfully short time the various officers
would begin to organize the various departments
of a new army-corps; the people would flock to
their standard. Even in a day or two the faint
outline of a new political form or movement
would show itself; and in a week this might become
substantial enough to exhibit serious manifestations
of force!</p>

<p>The general application of this to the question
in hand is obvious enough. But there is another
point which it illustrates—a point which
we have raised before. I am convinced that
science will never yield any very fruitful understanding
of the world, until it recognizes that
<i>life</i> and <i>intelligence</i> (of course in the broadest
signification) pervade all the phenomena of
Nature. It is perfectly useless to try to explain
human development, human destiny, mental
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_191' id='p_191'>191</a></span>
activity, the forces of nature, and so forth, in
terms of dead matter. No explanation of such
a kind could possibly be satisfying. And more
and more it is becoming clear that even what
we call the inorganic world is as subtle and swift
in its responses as what we call the organic.
Many difficulties must inevitably arise in any attempted
solution of the problem before us—that
problem which is generally denoted by “the nature
of the soul and its relation to the body”; but
we shall never arrive at any harmonious view
of the whole question until we are persuaded,
and practically assume, that life and intelligence
in some degree are characteristic of all that
we call ‘matter’ as well as of all we call
mind, and pervade the whole structure of the universe.
We shall then see that the forces, for
instance, which organize and direct the human
body, even down to its minutest parts, are probably
just as individual and intelligent in their
action as those (to take the example just given)
which organize and direct an army-corps.</p>

<h1 id='t6007'>CHAPTER XI<br/>&ensp;<br/>ON THE CREATION AND MATERIALIZATION OF FORMS</h1>

<p><span class='sc'>I have</span> suggested more than once, in preceding
chapters of this book, and in <i>The Art of Creation</i>
and elsewhere, that in the ordinary evolution of
thought, in dreams, in trance and in other
psychic states, we are witness of a process which
is continually and eternally going on, by which
the faintest invisible forms and outlines, the
nearest cloud-currents of the inner soul, gradually
condense themselves, pass into visibility,
tangibility, and so forth, and (if the process is
continued) ultimately take their place among the
substantial things of the outer world.</p>

<p>Hitherto this thought has been applied in
certain departments of inquiry, but I am of
impression that its considerable and world-wide
significance has been missed. Freud, in his
<i>Traumdeutung</i>, insists that behind the dream, and
inspiring its action and symbolism there always
lurks an emotion, a desire, a wish. And Havelock
Ellis (though with due caution) corroborates
this. He speaks<a id='r102'/><a href='#f102' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[102]</span></sup></a> of “the controlling power
of emotion on dream-ideas,” and says, “the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_193' id='p_193'>193</a></span>
fundamental source of our dream-life may be said
to be emotion.” That is, an emotion (from
whatever source) arises in the mind. Vague and
cloudlike at first, it presently takes form, and
(if in sleep) clothes itself with the imagery of a
dream, which becomes at last vivid and dramatic
and <i>real</i>, to a degree which astounds us. But
dream-life is only a paraphrase, so to speak, of
waking life—a phase largely corresponding to
the waking life of children<a id='r103'/><a href='#f103' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[103]</span></sup></a> and animals; and
in waking life the same thing happens. A wish
or desire appears in the background of the mind;
it moves forward and becomes a definite thought
and a plan; then it moves forward again and becomes
an action; the action creates a result; and
the desire finally establishes itself or its image in
the actual world. These emotions and desires
and the images which sprung from them have a
certain vitality and growth-power of their own.
The figures in dreams move of themselves and
concatenate with each other of their own accord—much
as the figures do in a drama, as Coleridge
long ago observed—and as the waking
thoughts of all of us do, when we leave them a
little to themselves and to go with loose rein.
More than that; in some cases waking thoughts
or passions become powerful enough to take possession
of the whole man and embody themselves
in his deeds—sometimes to heroic, sometimes
to criminal ends. Or, taking possession of
<i>portions</i> of the man, they precipitate conflict
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_194' id='p_194'>194</a></span>
within him. The dramatic quality of dreams is
evidently due to the different figures or incidents
of the dream being inspired by different
qualities or experiences of the dreamer; and in
the waking man the same process may lead to
tragic struggles and disintegrations of personality.
In hysteric patients, where the central controlling
power is weak, the very thought or fear of a disease
may seize upon a certain centre in the body
and stimulate there all the symptoms of that disease;
or a mental image may seize upon a certain
portion of the brain, and break up the personality
with strange new manifestations.</p>

<p>In all these cases, and scores of others which
we cannot consider now, the same action is taking
place—by which invisible psychic and spiritual
forces, for good or evil, are ever pressing forward
into the manifest, and condensing themselves into
visible and even tangible forms, or taking possession
of existing forms for the purpose of expression
and manifestation. And here we have
(as I think will be seen one day) the whole
rationale of Creation—we have the conception
which brings into line the phenomena of the visible
and material world and their genesis, with the
genesis of thoughts in our own minds, and
<i>their</i> passage into visibility and expression; we
have the conception which unites the mental and
material, and which makes the whole Creation
luminous with meaning. Especially is this obvious
to-day, when the theory of electrons is introducing
us to a world as far finer and subtler
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_195' id='p_195'>195</a></span>
than the atom, as the atom is finer and subtler
than the tangible world of our experience; and
is suggesting that these finest states of matter are
of the nature of electrical charges, which,
again, are quite analogous to mental states.<a id='r104'/><a href='#f104' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[104]</span></sup></a>
Thus we have, almost forced upon us as the
key to the creation of visible forms, the conception,
of a process of condensation by which the
most subtle thought and emotion does in
course of time (brief or lengthy) tend to manifest
itself in material shape, and may ultimately take
on the most persistent and quasi-indestructible
forms.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Reverting, then, to the subject of last chapter,
we see that a ‘spiritual’ body—that is, a material
body of a texture so fine and so swiftly plastic
as to be the analogue of thought—is a conception
quite in line with the conclusions of modern
science; and that granted the existence of such
a thing, it is quite in line also to conclude that
it would tend toward condensation and manifestation
in grosser and more visible form. I gave
in that chapter some general outline of how
such condensation might take place. I now propose
to consider this process more in detail, and
to give some evidence as to its actually taking
place.</p>

<p>There is something perhaps a little comic
about the idea of spirit photography—something
which has thus helped to retard its acceptance.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_196' id='p_196'>196</a></span>
The busy photographer with his camera is so
banal, and sometimes so obnoxious, a figure,
that to think of him photographing a ghost,
or the spirit of a dead relation, verges on bathos
or the burlesque. Nevertheless, Nature does not
attend to our canons in such matters, and in
reality the thing is perfectly feasible and in
order. It is well known that the photographic
plate is most sensitive to the violet end of the
spectrum—that it is this end which has the
actinic quality. Moreover, it is known that the
actinic quality extends <i>beyond</i> this end, and that
there are ultra-violet rays which we cannot see,
and which yet are photographically powerful.
But the violet rays, as is also well known, are
those whose light-waves are smallest—being only
about half the size of the red waves;<a id='r105'/><a href='#f105' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[105]</span></sup></a> and the
ultra-violet rays are still smaller. Consequently,
by means of the violet end of the spectrum,
information can be got about small objects and
infinitesimal details which would elude the more
ordinary light. A particle, in fact, may be so
small that it would reflect the violet waves, while
it would be unable to reflect the red—just as a
boat floating on the water will reflect and turn
back tiny ripples, while it will simply be tossed
about by good-sized waves. Advantage has been
taken of this in microscopy, and by ingenious arrangements
photographs of objects under the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_197' id='p_197'>197</a></span>
microscope can now be taken by ultra-violet light,
so as to show the very minutest details.</p>

<p>The application of this to the question before
us is clear. If there be a spiritual body, composed
of particles so infinitesimal as to be—to
begin with—far beyond the limits of visibility,
yet gradually condensing and accreting to themselves
other and subsidiary particles, there might
come a time when such a cloud-form would approach
the limit of visibility—the molecules of
which it was composed having grown so far.
It would be perfectly natural, then, for a body
composed of such molecules to come into the
region of possible photography in the camera
through the ultra-violet rays <i>before</i> it came into
the region of visibility to the human eye by
means of ordinary light. And thus the seeming
paradox may be accounted for—of the appearance
of spirit-forms, or even thought-forms, on the
photographic plate which are not yet discernible
by the eye. At a later stage of materialization
the form may of course yield an image both to the
eye and to the camera.<a id='r106'/><a href='#f106' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[106]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Again, in this connection, it is often urged
against the reality of spirit-forms, ghosts, and
so forth, that they cannot bear a strong light;
and this is held to dispose of all their claims
for consideration. But what has just been said
shows that on the contrary such an effect is just
what might be expected. The delicate growing
structure, whose particles were just large enough
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_198' id='p_198'>198</a></span>
to reflect the smaller light-waves, might easily be
broken up and quite disintegrated by the larger
and more powerful weaves of a strong glare—just
as, in fact, <i>our</i> forms, which can endure
light, are broken up and disintegrated by the
still larger waves of intense <i>heat</i>. Katie King,
who, as before mentioned, appeared so many times
in connection with the medium Florence Cook,
was frequently seen to fade away if the light
was too strong. “At the earlier seances she
could only come out of the cabinet for a few
seconds at a time, once or twice during the
seance; she had to go back quickly into the
cabinet to gather fresh power from her medium,
saying that the strong and unaccustomed brilliancy
of the light made her ‘melt quite away.’”<a id='r107'/><a href='#f107' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[107]</span></sup></a>
And Nepenthes, that finely formed and beautiful
figure which appeared in connection with Mme.
D’Espérance, was more than once seen, by a
large company assembled, to walk by the side of
the medium up to the open French window at the
end of the room and then to disappear as she
came into the full daylight.<a id='r108'/><a href='#f108' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[108]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Photographs, it may be noticed, of forms appearing
at seances, or in connection with sitters,
vary from mere cloudlike masses without or almost
without shape to very distinct human
figures with much detail of feature and dress,<a id='r109'/><a href='#f109' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[109]</span></sup></a>—the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_199' id='p_199'>199</a></span>
same figure being often recognized in various
stages of clearness and definition. And
this is interesting because it entirely corroborates
the observations made in hundreds of seances,
and in other cases, in which a form is first distinguished
by the eye as a faintly luminous cloud,
and gradually grows in distinctness and definition
till it becomes visible in all detail, and
even tangible. Mme. D’Espérance, whose book,
<i>Shadowland</i>, should be read on account of its intelligent
handling and obvious sincerity, as well
as on account of the remarkable phenomena reported,
describes (p. 151) the first occasion
on which a ‘materialization’ appeared to her:—“One
evening, for some reason or other, we were
sitting without a lighted lamp. The daylight had
not faded when we commenced the sitting, but
though it grew dark no one suggested making
a light. Happening to glance over to the part of
the room where the shadows were deepest it
seemed to me that there was a curious cloudy
luminosity standing out distinct and clear from
the darkness. I watched it for a minute or two
without saying anything, wondering where it
came from and how it was caused. I thought
it must be a reflection from the street lamps outside,
though I had never seen it like that before.
While I watched, the luminous cloud seemed to
concentrate itself, become substantial, and
form itself into a figure of a child, illuminated
as it were by daylight that did not shine
on it but, somehow, from within it—the darkness
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_200' id='p_200'>200</a></span>
of the room seeming to act as a background,
throwing up by contrast every curve of the form
and every feature into strong relief.” And in
another passage she says:—“As soon as I have
entered the mediumistic cabinet my first impression
is of being covered with spider webs. Then
I feel that the air is filled with substance, and
a kind of white and vaporous mass, quasi-luminous,
like the steam from a locomotive, is
formed in front of the abdomen. After this
mass has been tossed and agitated in every way
for some minutes, sometimes even for half-an-hour,
it suddenly stops, and then out of it is
born a living being close by me.”<a id='r110'/><a href='#f110' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[110]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Another figure—that of Yolande (a young
woman)—is mentioned in the same book (p. 254)
as appearing again and again out of such a
filmy cloudy patch on the floor. Similarly,
Professor Richet noticed over and over again
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_201' id='p_201'>201</a></span>
the outgrowth of a figure (Beni Boa) from a
white cloud. “Near the cabinet we could see,
betwixt the curtain and the table, a whitish globe
forming, luminous, and rotating on the floor;
from this globe Beni Boa sprang.” The figure
would then walk round the room and disappear
again; but after a time the white cloud would
again form and Beni Boa reappear. And Professor
Lombroso, alluding to this, says:<a id='r111'/><a href='#f111' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[111]</span></sup></a>—“This
observation is of great importance, since it is
not possible to attribute to fraud the formation
of a luminous patch on the floor which transforms
itself into a living being.” Further,
Lombroso says:—“Five photographs were obtained
at these sittings by magnesium and
chlorate of potash light, with a Kodak and with
a Richard stereoscopic apparatus simultaneously,
which fact excludes the possibility of photographic
fraud; and all the plates were developed
in Algeria by an optician who was unaware of
what had preceded. On the plates appeared a tall
figure wrapped in a white mantle” (and similar
to the figure which the seven sitters present at the
seances had seen).</p>

<p>I have alluded to this cloud-formation before as
characteristic of an early stage of the appearance
of these figures, and as suggesting a process of
condensation going on. Lombroso, from various
considerations which he brings forward (p. 185),<a id='r112'/><a href='#f112' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[112]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_202' id='p_202'>202</a></span>
seems convinced that the phenomena of these
forms are largely connected with radio-activity.
He says:—“It would seem that these bodies
belong to that further state of matter, the
radiant state, which now at last has established a
firm footing in science—and which thus offers the
only hypothesis which can reconcile the ancient
and universal belief in the persistence of some
form of life after death with the postulates of
science which maintain that without organ there
can be no function.” This radio-active condition
of matter is of course that finest and most active
state represented by the electrons—in which each
electron is excessively minute,<a id='r113'/><a href='#f113' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[113]</span></sup></a> yet moves at
enormous speed, and carries with it an electric
charge. It connects itself with condensation in
this way, that “an electric charge assists vapor
to condense,” and “where ions (<i>i.e.</i> positively or
negatively charged particles) are present in considerable
numbers a thick mist will form whenever
the space is saturated with vapor.”<a id='r114'/><a href='#f114' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[114]</span></sup></a> And
Fournier d’Albe says:<a id='r115'/><a href='#f115' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[115]</span></sup></a>—“In the physical theory
of ionization and condensation we have become
familiar with the fact that the smallest charged
particles are the most effective promoters of condensation.
In fact, it would suffice to extract a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_203' id='p_203'>203</a></span>
very small proportion of the innumerable electrons
within the body to bring about a vigorous
condensation in the moist air around it.”</p>

<p>Thus it is quite probable that the cloud-formation,
which in general precedes the manifestation
of distinct figures, is due to condensation,
and in part at any rate to a condensation of
water-vapor on the accreting particles of the
spirit-body. And this is made the more probable
by the strong sensation of <i>cold</i> which so frequently
accompanies these appearances, and
which is a common accompaniment of condensation.
Crookes, in his <i>Researches</i>, emphasizes
this in connection with almost all the phenomena,
and says<a id='r116'/><a href='#f116' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[116]</span></sup></a> they “are generally preceded by a
peculiar cold air, sometimes amounting to a decided
wind. I have had sheets of paper blown
about by it, and a thermometer lowered several
degrees. On some occasions ... the cold has
been so intense that I could only compare it to
that felt when the hand has been within a few
inches of frozen mercury.” Some such sensation
seems to be quite a common experience, and the
authoress of <i>Shadowland</i>, speaking of her earlier
sittings (p. 228), says:—“It was not long before
the same strange disturbances in the air
began as on the previous occasion. I felt my
hair blown and lifted by currents of air, and cool
breezes played about my face and hands.”</p>

<p>Thus (with the corroborating evidence of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_204' id='p_204'>204</a></span>
Crookes’ thermometer) we may suppose that,
after all, the cold airs and shivering sensations
which seem so often to accompany apparitions
may not be merely subjective to the observer, but
may be real phenomena due to physical condensations
taking place in his immediate proximity.
Moreover, it has to be noted that the condensations
may not be merely of water-vapor, but of
other substances as well, namely (according to an
opinion now gaining ground), of fine matter or effluences
provided by the bodies of the sitters present
(or some of them) as well as by the body of
the medium. The passage last quoted from
<i>Shadowland</i> continues: “then began a strange sensation,
which I had sometimes felt at seances.
Frequently I have heard it described by others as
of cobwebs being passed over the face, but to me,
who watched it curiously, it seemed that I could
feel fine threads being drawn out of the pores of
my skin.” And in another passage<a id='r117'/><a href='#f117' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[117]</span></sup></a> the same
writer describes the cloud which precedes a materialization
as “a slightly luminous haze” which
often appears “about the head, shoulders, elbows
and sometimes the knees and feet (of the
medium). Frequently it gathers slowly at the
fingers, increasing in density till it resembles a
slight transparent film of slightly luminous cotton
wool.” Further, she explains that it goes on condensing
till it becomes cobwebby and perceptible
to touch. The evidence generally seems to show
that these clouds are of the nature of effluences
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_205' id='p_205'>205</a></span>
from the medium or other person present; and
the above quotation affords corroboration of that
view and makes easily intelligible the great exhaustion
from which mediums often suffer on
these occasions. It suggests also that the condensation
is by no means of water-vapor only, but of
other substances drawn from the interior vitality
of the persons concerned, and necessary for the
building up of the apparitional form.</p>

<p>It is difficult in the case, for instance, of “Katie
King,” who, as already said, appeared hundreds
of times during two or three years, or of Estella
Martha, who appeared to her husband during
five years and in 380 or more seances in connection
with the medium Kate Fox,<a id='r118'/><a href='#f118' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[118]</span></sup></a> not to believe
that such figures are (as we should say) <i>really</i> the
individuals they profess to be, and not mere
thought-forms or images projected from the
medium’s under-mind. But whichever view we
take, it is obvious that they are centres in some
degree, of intelligent force or vitality, centres
which, though in their essence rare and tenuous
as thought or feeling, succeed in clothing themselves
with a certain grade of corporeality by the
use of the materials at hand, and in so coming
into visible manifestation. And this general view
is confirmed by the fact, so often observed,
that when the same figure appears repeatedly, it
does, as time goes on, acquire skill and adroitness
in carrying out the process of condensation
or whatever it is, which is concerned, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_206' id='p_206'>206</a></span>
consequently comes into manifestation and activity
more quickly and decisively. Also, it may be
noted, and has often been observed (as in the
case of the said Estella Martha and many
others), that by practice the figure attains the
power of enduring strong light—that is, its state
of condensation reaches a point of solidity almost
comparable with that of <i>our</i> tissues, which are not
as a rule disintegrated by light.</p>

<p>The radio-activity of the ‘inner being’ also
helps to explain the extraordinary manifestations
of sheer physical force in these connections.
Some of these manifestations have been so
astonishing, that the fact alone has caused them
to be disbelieved; but though, of course, fraud
has played a part in such phenomena, and has
to be guarded against, it is now quite evident
that in a multitude of cases fraud does not enter
at all.</p>

<p>Eusapia Paladino, for instance—though capable
of little fraudulences—was obviously the
seat of extraordinary powers not to be explained
by these. Mr. Carrington, who made a special
study of this medium, and who (as I have said
before) has also made a special study of fraudulent
methods in so-called spiritualism, vouches
most strongly for the great exhibitions of inexplicable
<i>force</i> in her vicinity—especially perhaps
in the way of <i>levitations</i>. He says:—“Every
one who has studied Eusapia’s phenomena knows
that practically every seance (for some reason)
commences with table-levitations—this, whether
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_207' id='p_207'>207</a></span>
they are wanted or not! It seems the necessary
programme, and it is almost invariably carried
out. Seeing them time after time, one can obtain
a very fair idea of their nature and reality. And
I may say that I now consider levitations
as well established as any other physical facts.
They are not open to the objection to which most
psychical phenomena are subjected—that they
cannot be repeated or induced and studied experimentally,
as one would study other physical facts—for
they can be induced and studied in just
this laboratory manner. I have probably seen
several hundreds of these levitations now, under
every conceivable condition and in <i>excellent light</i>,
and I consider them so far established that, as
Count Solovovo said, “the burden of proof is now
on the man who asserts that they are <i>not</i> real,
not upon the man who asserts that they <i>are</i>.”
These are pretty strong words, and by a very
responsible observer! And then Mr. Carrington
proceeds with a detailed account of these and
other physical phenomena.<a id='r119'/><a href='#f119' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[119]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Some years ago, the reports and accounts of
such phenomena were generally at once dismissed
as absurd and incredible; but by a remarkable
coincidence the last few years have seen the
wonderful development of the science of radio-activity—dating
from the epoch-making experiments
of Crookes, in 1879 and earlier. These
experiments, curiously enough, were worked out
during much of the same period as Crookes’
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_208' id='p_208'>208</a></span>
researches into spiritualistic phenomena, and have
led to the shedding of much light upon the latter.
For the new science developed from them,
and already more or less popularized,<a id='r120'/><a href='#f120' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[120]</span></sup></a> compels
us to suppose that the most enormous forces
lurk all around, within the very structure of
the atom itself—which of course is totally invisible
to our eyes. The new facts observed,
with regard to radium and other such substances,
seem to compel the supposition that each atom
is composed of an immense number (say 100,000)
of highly charged electrical particles moving each
with huge velocity—a velocity at any rate comparable
to that of light. The dissociation of
such atoms and the liberation of their constituent
particles develops a fabulous energy. When it
is calculated that one gramme or fifteen grains
of matter (say the weight of thirty postage
stamps) moving with the speed of light, would
have energy enough to lift the British Navy to
the top of Ben Nevis (Crookes); or that one
milligramme (say the sixty-sixth part of a grain
of wheat) at the same speed would represent the
energy of fifteen million foot-tons (Lodge); or
when, according to J. J. Thomson, the combined
speed and mass of the electrons within such a
milligramme of matter would total up to the
work represented by a hundred million kilogram-metres;<a id='r121'/><a href='#f121' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[121]</span></sup></a>
then we can at any rate see—whatever
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_209' id='p_209'>209</a></span>
small variations there may be in the estimates—how
immense are the potentialities of the tiniest
points of matter; how each minutest atom
comprehends, as Shelley says, “a world of loves
and hatreds” (<i>i.e.</i> positive and negative electric
charges); we realize that no manifestations of
unexpected power are <i>per se</i> incredible; and we
are indeed rather inclined to wonder how it is
that these great inter-atomic energies do not more
often force themselves on our attention!</p>

<p>It is evident that any such condition of being
as we have supposed in the case of the ‘inner’
or ‘spiritual’ body, might afford means for the
liberation—even from a single atom—of forces
amply sufficient for the most ‘miraculous’ phenomena;
and we are led to wonder and to ask
whether it may not be the case that, after all,
our gross bodies are really a hindrance rather
than a help—whether it may not be true that
the powers we could exert <i>without</i> them and independently
of muscles and sinews and hands
and feet would be far greater than those we
actually do exert by means of these organs and
appendages; whether, in fact, our gross bodies
do not exercise a <i>limiting</i> effect, confining our
activities to certain very clearly specified directions,
and within certain very definite bounds?
At any rate, this point of view is worth considering.</p>

<p>Certainly the well-established facts of telepathy,
and the equally well-established facts of
the projection of phantoms from persons dying,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_210' id='p_210'>210</a></span>
or passing through great danger, to friends even
at a great distance, seem to show that the inner
self of one person can send out rays or in some
way impress itself on the inner self of another
far-off person;<a id='r122'/><a href='#f122' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[122]</span></sup></a> and this, under the theory of
electrons moving at prodigious speed, seems not
impossible. For though there is a difficulty in
supposing ordinary physical vibrations or radiations
to reach effectively from one person to another
(say a thousand miles away) on account of
the law of space itself, which makes such radiations
diminish in intensity as the square of the distance
increases, yet in the case of electrical radiations
it seems possible to suppose two people related
to each other as positive and negative poles—in
which case the radiations of electric charges
would pass along lines connecting the two, and
with comparatively little loss of intensity. Our
present rather crude and lumbering bodies probably
impede these subtle exertions of force; and
the fact (already noted once or twice) of the
greater activity of people in the telepathic or
phantasmogenetic directions, when they are themselves
outwardly in a dying or exhausted condition,
seems to point to a considerable liberation of
these powers after death.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the well-established facts
of perceptivity at a great distance, or without
the mediation of the gross body and the usual
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_211' id='p_211'>211</a></span>
end-organs, point in the same direction. Considerable
investigations have been made in this
subject; and not only is the evidence for occasional
clairvoyance at a distance well established,
but there are curious cases in which the faculty
of sight or of hearing seems to be transferred
from its natural organ to some other part of
the body, as of seeing with the knee, or the
stomach, or the finger-tips. Myers gives considerable
attention to this subject, and thinks that
Professor Fontan’s experiments<a id='r123'/><a href='#f123' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[123]</span></sup></a> “cannot lightly
be set aside”; while Lombroso quotes an hysterical
patient of his own, a girl of fourteen, who
lost the sight of her eyes, but was able to read
perfectly with the lobe of her left ear! Later
on, in the same patient, the sense of smell
concentrated itself in the heel of her foot! Mrs.
Piper, as is well known, commonly raises her
<i>hand</i> for the sitter to speak into, as if it were
her ear. And in cases of somnambulism the
sleepwalker will sometimes move securely through
difficult or dangerous places with eyes absolutely
closed. All these things seem to point to an
aboriginal power of perception independent of
the end-organs. It is obvious that if in the course
of evolution our present faculties of sight,
hearing, and so forth have been developed from
the diffused sensitivity of an amœba or some such
creature, then those faculties must have existed,
in their undifferentiated state, in the
amœba; or, to put the matter another way,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_212' id='p_212'>212</a></span>
the faculty of sight clearly does not reside in
the cornea of the eye, or in the crystalline lens,
or even in the retina itself; which are merely an
apparatus evolved for dealing with the details of
the matter. The retina catches the light-disturbance,
and the optic nerve conveys it to
the brain, and the brain-cells are agitated by it;
but where does <i>sight</i> come in? At some point,
doubtless, the agitations of the brain-cells or
of their internal molecules are <i>seen</i> and interpreted;
but the being that sees and interprets
them may (we had almost said <i>must</i>) be capable
of directly seeing and interpreting similar agitations
in the outer world—that is, it may or must
by its nature be capable of seeing the events of
the outer world without the mediation of the
end-organs or the brain. Frederick Myers, dealing
with this subject, says:—“I start from the
thesis that the perceptive power within us precedes
and is independent of the specialized sense-organs,
which it has developed for earthly use.
‘It is the mind that sees and the mind that hears,
the other things are blind and deaf.’”<a id='r124'/><a href='#f124' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[124]</span></sup></a> He
thinks that in the development or unfolding of
life on our planet “certain sensibilities got themselves
defined and stereotyped upon the organism
by the evolution of end-organs. Others failed to
get thus externalized; but may, for aught we
know, persist nevertheless in the central organs.”<a id='r125'/><a href='#f125' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[125]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_213' id='p_213'>213</a></span>
It is evident—however we may explain the matter—that
activities and sensibilities do persist and
manifest themselves in the human organism quite
independent of the ordinary and stereotyped end-organs,
and this fact must go far to persuade us,
not only that there is an inner, a more subtle, and
a more durable body than that which we
usually recognize, but that in some respects
this latter body is a limitation and a hindrance
to the activity of the former, and to the
swiftness and range of the perceptions of the
soul.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>What, then, it will naturally be asked, is the object
or purpose or use of our incarnation in this
grosser body?—why, if there is such an ethereal
or spiritual frame within, should it thus tend to
accrete denser particles upon itself and ultimately
to clothe itself in a vesture of so
opaque and material a nature? It would be
rash to attempt to answer so profound a
question offhand—off one’s own bat as it were;
and still more rash perhaps to accept any of the
ready-made answers which are offered in such
profusion, and in so many different jargons and
lingos, by the sects and schools, from the Gnostics
and Theosophists to the most philistine of
the chapels and churches. Yet if one may venture
a suggestion, it would seem rather likely that
the object and purpose and use of this process
by which the soul is entangled in matter, and
its operation and perception so strangely
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_214' id='p_214'>214</a></span>
hampered and limited, is—limitation; that <i>limitation</i>
itself and even <i>hindrance</i> are part and parcel of
the great scheme of the soul’s deliverance. But
the further consideration of this I will defer to a
later chapter.<a id='r126'/><a href='#f126' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[126]</span></sup></a></p>

<h1 id='t6687'>CHAPTER XII<br/>&ensp;<br/>REINCARNATION</h1>

<p><span class='sc'>There</span> is a good deal of talk indulged in, on
the subject of Reincarnation—talk of a rather
cheap character. One does not quite see what
is the use of saying that the <i>ego</i> will be reincarnated
again some day, unless one has some sort
of idea what one means by the <i>ego</i>, and unless
one has some understanding of the sense in
which the word “reincarnation” is used. If it
is meant that your local and external self, approximately
as you and your friends know it to-day—including
dress, facial outline, professional skill,
accomplishments, habits of mind and body, interests
and enthusiasms—is going to repeat itself
again in five or five hundred years, or has already
appeared in this form in the past; one can only
say “impossible!” and “I trust not!” For all
these things depend on date, locality, heredity,
surrounding institutions, social habits, current morality,
and so forth, which—though they have
certainly played their part in the spirit’s growth—must
infallibly be different at any other period
(short of the whole universe repeating itself).
And anyhow to have them repeated again <i>da
capo</i> at some future time would be terribly dull.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_216' id='p_216'>216</a></span>
But if you say “Of course I don’t mean anything
so silly as <i>that</i>,” it becomes incumbent on you
to say what you do mean.</p>

<p>Supposing, for instance, you had been planked
down a baby in the Arabian desert, and grown
up to maturity or middle age there, instead
of where you are, would any of your present-day
friends recognize you? Where would be
your charming piano-playing, your excellent
cricket, your rather sloppy water-color painting,
your up-to-dateness in the theatrical world?
Where your morality (with three wives of
course) or your religion (something about
“Christian dogs”), or where your British <i>sang
froid</i> and impeccability? And if it is obvious that
in such a case as this you would, owing to the
changed conditions, be changed out of all recognition,
much more—one might say—would this be
the case if you had been born five hundred years
ago, or were to be born again five hundred years
hence. Your whole outlook on life, and its whole
impress on you, would be different.</p>

<p>Of course I am not meaning, by these remarks,
to say that reincarnation is in itself impossible
or absurd; that would be prejudging the question.
All I mean at present is that if we are going
to study this subject, or theorize upon it, it
is really necessary to define in some degree the
terms which we use. I do not say that you,
the reader, might not be reincarnated, but I
think it is clear that if you were, we should have
a good deal of trouble in following and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_217' id='p_217'>217</a></span>
finding you! It is clear that the <i>you</i>, so reappearing,
would not be your well-known local and
external self, but some deep nucleus, difficult perhaps
for your best friend to recognize, and
possibly even unknown or unrecognized by yourself
at present. And similarly of some friend
that you love for a thousand little tricks and
ways. We all have such friends, and at times
cherish a sentimental romance of their being
restored to us in some future æon habited in their
old guise and with their well-worn frocks and
coats. But surely it is no good playing at hide-and-seek
like that. The common difficulties about
the conventional heaven—the difficulty about
meeting your old friend who used to be so good
at after-dinner stories, about meeting him
with a harp in his hand and sitting on a
damp cloud—is no whit the less a difficulty
whatever future world may be the <i>rendezvous</i>.
He would be changed (externally) and we should
be changed, and it might well happen that if
we did seem to recall any former intimacy we
should both feel like strangers, and be as shy
and tentative in our approaches to each other as
school-children.</p>

<p>What do we mean by the letter “I”? and
what do we mean by the word Reincarnation?
These two questions wait for a reply.</p>

<p>The first is a terribly difficult question. It
lies (though neglected by the philosophers themselves)
at the root of all philosophy. Perhaps
really all life and experience are nothing but an
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_218' id='p_218'>218</a></span>
immense search for the answer. What do we
mean by the Ego? It is a sort of fundamental
question, which it might be supposed would precede
all other questions, but which as a matter
of fact seems to be postponed to all
others, and is the last to be solved. All we
can at the outset be sure of in the way of answer
is the enormous extent and depth of the
being we are setting out to define. We
sometimes think of the <i>ego</i> as a mere point
of consciousness, or we think of the ordinary
self of daily life as a fragile and ephemeral
entity bounded by a few bodily tissues and
a few mental views and habits. But even
the slight discussion of the subject in former
chapters of this book (chapters vi., vii., and
so forth) has revealed to us the vast underlying
stores and faculties which must be
included—the wonderful powers of memory,
the subtle capacities of perception at a distance,
or without the usual organs of sight
and hearing, the power of creating images
out of the depths of one’s mind, and of
impressing them telepathically upon others,
the faculty of clairvoyance in past and future
time, and so forth. The more we try to fathom
this ego, with which we supposed ourselves so
familiar, the more we are amazed at its labyrinthine
profundity, and the more we are astonished
to think that we should ever have
ventured to limit it to such a petty formula and
conventional symbol as we commonly do—not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_219' id='p_219'>219</a></span>
only in our judgment of friends, but even in our
estimate of ourselves.</p>

<p>Reincarnation, as we have already said, can
hardly be the reappearance, in a new life on
earth (or even in some other sphere), of the very
local and superficial traits which we know so well
in ourselves and our friends—which are mainly
a response to local and superficial conditions, and
which mainly constitute what we call our personalities.
If reincarnation does occur, it
must obviously consist in the reappearance or
remanifestation of some such very interior self
as we have just spoken of—some deep individuality
(as opposed to personality), some divine
æonian soul, some offshoot perhaps of an age-long
enduring Race-soul, or World-self—and in
that sort of sense only shall I use the word in
future.</p>

<p>In that sense the idea is feasible and illuminative.
It explains the obvious limitations and
localism of our personalities, as being more or
less passing and temporary embodiments of our
true selves; and it represents the latter as immense
storehouses of experience from all manner
of places and times, and similarly as centres of
world-activity operating in different fields of time
and space. At the same time, it presents various
difficulties. For one thing, it poses the difficulty
that for each of us this vast interior being
is, as a rule, so deeply buried that both oneself
and one’s friends are only faintly conscious—if
at all—of its true outline. And if one does
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_220' id='p_220'>220</a></span>
not recognize this being, of what use is it to us?
It is true that we sometimes meet people who at
first sight give us a strong impression of far-back
intimacy; but this is only a vague impression and
hardly sufficient to afford proof of pre-existence.
The only way of meeting this difficulty seems to
be to suppose, as residing in this inner being or
true self, another order of consciousness, faint
intimations of which we even now have, and by
which, as it grows and develops, we may some
day clearly recognize our true selves and true
nature.</p>

<p>Another difficulty is that (as already said) for
any satisfactory sense of survival continuity of
memory is needed; and we should have to suppose
that the memory of each earth-life was continued
into and stored up in this deeper soul or æonian
self. Memory would not normally pass from
one embodiment or incarnation to another, but
each stream would flow into the central self and
there be stored. And I think we may admit that
this is by no means impossible. Indeed there
are not a few facts (some already mentioned)
with regard to the recovery of memory which
make the mater probable. Though any given
earth-life in a given form could not be repeated,
the <i>memory</i> of such an earth-life, fresh and clear,
may survive for an indefinite time in the crystal
mirror of the deeper consciousness.<a id='r127'/><a href='#f127' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[127]</span></sup></a> And it is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_221' id='p_221'>221</a></span>
perhaps allowable to suppose that in this way,
and with the lifting of the opaque veil of our
present consciousness, we may some day come
clearly into the presence of friends we have lost.</p>

<p>Here again, however, one has to be on one’s
guard. The mere fact of remembering (or thinking
one remembers), in this our terrestrial life
and with our terrestrial consciousness, some detail
or other of a previous terrestrial life proves
little—for, for aught we know, quite apart from
our psychic selves, a streak of memory of more
physical origin from some ancestor may have
come down even several generations, and may
be surviving in one’s brain.<a id='r128'/><a href='#f128' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[128]</span></sup></a> Indeed it is extremely
probable that all organic matter carries
memory with it, and not unlikely that inorganic
matter does so too. If you thought, for instance,
that you remembered seeing Charles the First
beheaded—if you had a rather distinct picture in
your mind of the scene at Whitehall, which you
afterwards found by investigation to be corroborated
in its details, you might at first jump to the
conclusion that you had really lived at that time,
and witnessed the scene. But after all it might
merely be that an ancestor of yours had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_222' id='p_222'>222</a></span>
there, and that the vividly impressed picture had
somehow persevered in some subterranean channel
of memory and emerged again in your mind.
Even then you might contend that, since it was
<i>your</i> memory, <i>you</i> must have been there—or at
any rate some fraction of yourself in the ancestor,
which now has become incorporated in your personality.
There are a good many stories of this
kind going about, which point to the possibility
of the transmission of shreds of remembrance
through hereditary channels, and suggest the idea
of an active Race-memory, or Earth-memory, in
itself continuous—a storehouse of experiences,
but fed continually by the individuals of the race,
and coruscating forth again in other individuals.<a id='r129'/><a href='#f129' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[129]</span></sup></a>
Indeed one can hardly withhold belief in the
existence of such a larger life, or identity, ‘reincarnated’
if one likes to use the expression, in
thousands or millions of individuals; but to be
satisfactorily assured of the reincarnation of one
distinct and individual person is another thing,
and would almost demand that there should be
forthcoming not only shreds and streaks of remembrance,
but a pretty continuous and consistent
memory of a whole former life.</p>

<p>Thus the whole question which we are discussing
is baffled and rendered the more complex by
the doubt as to what is meant by the word “I.”
It is clear, from what we have already said, that
one person may use it to indicate (1) the quite
local and superficial self; while another may have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_223' id='p_223'>223</a></span>
in mind (2) a much profounder being (the underlying
self) whose depths and qualities we have by
no means fathomed; while others, again, may be
thinking (3) of the self of the Race or the Earth,
or (4) the All-self of the universe.</p>

<p>I present these questions and doubts, not—as I
have said—for the purpose of discrediting the
possibility of Reincarnation, but by way of showing
how complex and difficult the problem is, and
how much <i>some</i> exact thought and definition is
needed in dealing with it. At the same time, in
pleading for exact thought I would also urge that
in avoiding the whirlpools of sentimentalism we
should be careful not to fall upon the rocks of a
dry and barren formalism. Systems of hard and
fast doctrines on these subjects—even though issued
with all the authority of ancient tradition,
and enunciated in a long-dead jargon—are the
most unfruitful and uninspiring of things. They
seem to contain no germ of vitality and are liable
to paralyze the mind that feeds upon them. Besides
the drawback—as I have pointed out before—that
all such systems are inevitably false. Nature
does not, in any department, work upon a
cut-and-dried system; and while at the outset of
an investigation we often seem to discern something
of that kind, further study invariably discloses
an astounding variety of order and method.
It may be well therefore to be prepared to find
a general principle of Reincarnation in operation
in the world, but worked out, in actual fact, in
a great variety of ways.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_224' id='p_224'>224</a></span>
Certainly there comes into our minds, at a
certain grade of their development, a deep persuasion
of the truth, in <i>some</i> sense, of reincarnation—that
“the Soul that rises with us, our life’s
Star, hath had elsewhere its setting.” It blossoms,
this persuasion, in a curious way, in the very
depths of the mind; and in moments of inner
illumination, or deep feeling, is discerned in a
way that seems to leave no room for doubt. At
the same time, it not only has this intuitive sanction,
but it commends itself also to the intellect,
because at a certain stage we perceive very clearly
both how vast is the whole curve of progress
which the soul has to cover from its first birth
to its final liberation, and how tiny is the arc
represented by a single lifetime—the two
thoughts almost compelling us to believe in a succession
of lives as the only explanation or solution.
We are compelled towards a practical belief in
Reincarnation, and yet (as above) we have to
confess that our conception of what it really is, or
what we mean by it, is only vague. This, however,
is no more than what happens in a hundred
other cases. The young bird starts building a nest
for the first time, driven by some strange instinct
to do so, and yet it can only have a very dim
notion of the meaning and uses the nest will subserve
when finished. And <i>we</i> found our lives on
deep intuitions—of social solidarity, of personal
responsibility, of free will, and so forth—and yet
it is only later and by degrees that we learn what
these things actually mean.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_225' id='p_225'>225</a></span>
Referring, then, to the four alternative forms
of the self given two or three pages back, and
taking the last first, we may say definitely, I think,
that as far as the self of each one of us is identified
(4) with the All-self of the universe, its reincarnation
is assured. Its reincarnation indeed
is perpetual, inexhaustible, multitudinous
beyond words, filling all space and time. Though
the consciousness of this self is deeply buried,
yet it is there, in each one of us. Occasionally—if
even only for a moment—it rises to the surface,
bringing a sense of splendor and of joy indescribable—the
absolute freedom and password of
all creation, the recognition of oneself everywhere
and in all forms. But this phase of the
self—I need hardly say—is for the most part
hidden; and more common is it perhaps for the
Race-self (3) to rise into our consciousness with
more or less distinct assurance that we live again
and are re-embodied in other members of the race
to which we belong. The common life of the race
carries us away and overmasters us with a strange
sense of identity and community of being.
Heroisms and devotions—as of men dying for
their country, or bees for their hive—spring from
this; and superb intoxications of joy. The whole
of the life of primitive races and tribes, and the
life of the animals and insects, illustrates it—in
warfares, migrations, crusades, frantic enthusiasms,
mad festivals—the genius of the race rushing on
from point to point, inspiring its children, incarnating
itself without end in successive individuals.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_226' id='p_226'>226</a></span>
It is not so uncommon, I say, for us to be able
to identify ourselves with this great Race-self,
and to feel its thrill and pulse within our veins.
And it might well be thought that, with these
two forms of reincarnation (3) and (4) and the
immense joy they bring, we should be content:
even as all the tribes of the animals and the
angels are content.</p>

<p>But it seems that man—when the civilization-period
sets in, and after that—is not content.
The little individual soul, now first coming to
the consciousness of its own separateness, sets up
a claim for an immortality and a reincarnation of
its very own—apart from the Race-self, apart
even from the Divine self. It demands that its
<i>ego</i> should continue indefinitely into the farthest
fields of Time—a separate entity, perpetually re-embodied.
Can such a claim—in the light of
what has been said above—be possibly conceded?</p>

<p>Certainly not. We have seen the absurdity
of supposing that the local and superficial self
(1) can ever recur again or be re-embodied in
that form, except as a mere matter of memory
(or possibly of a repetition of the whole universal
order). And as to the underlying self (2), whatever
exactly it may be, there are a thousand
reasons for seeing that <i>as a wholly separate entity</i>
the same must be true of that. I may refer the
reader to <i>The Art of Creation</i>, the whole argument
of which is to show that even the mere attempt
to <i>think</i> of itself as a separate entity involves
the human soul in hopeless confusion and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_227' id='p_227'>227</a></span>
disintegration; and I may remind the reader that
we know nothing in the whole universe which is
thus separate and apart, and that the conception,
whether from a physical point of view or a psychological
point of view, is impossible to maintain.
That being so, there remains only to consider
the possibility of the underlying self or
individual soul being re-embodied—not as an absolutely
separate entity, but as affiliated to some
greater Life which shall afford the basis of successive
incarnations. The problem is narrowed
down, practically to the question whether the individual
may not obtain some kind of individual
reincarnation through the Race-self, or possibly
through the All-self of the universe.</p>

<p>And here I will state what I personally think
and believe about this problem, leaving the reasons
for the present to commend themselves. I
think that in the early stages—in animal and
primitive human life—the Race-self is paramount;
that each individual self proceeds from
it, in much the same way as a bud proceeds from
the stem of a growing plant, or even as a
single cell forms part of the tissue of the
stem; and is absorbed into it again at death.
There are no individual and death-surviving
souls produced, apart from the Race-soul. In
the great race or family of bunny-rabbits, for
instance—though there are certainly individual
differences of character—just as there are differentiations
of tissue-cells in the stem of a plant—it
is difficult to believe that there are individual
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_228' id='p_228'>228</a></span>
and immortal souls. Each little self springs from
the race, and is an embodiment of it, representing
in various degree its characteristics; and at
death—in some way which we do not yet quite
understand<a id='r130'/><a href='#f130' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[130]</span></sup></a>—returns thither, yielding its experiences
to the stores of the race-experience. The
same is probably true of the great mass of the
higher animals, even up to the primitive and
earliest Man. The Race-self in all these cases
moves onward, upgathering the experiences of
the individuals, wise with their united knowledge,
and rich with their countless memories. And
these tracts again, of experience, knowledge and
memory, largely in a vague and generalized form,
but sometimes in sharp, individualized and detailed
form, are transmitted from the Race-self to
its later individuals and offshots. Thus a kind
of broken reincarnation occurs, by which streaks
of memory and habit pass down time from one
individual to another, and by which perhaps—in
us later races—the persistent ‘intimations of immortality’
and persuasions of having lived before
are accounted for.</p>

<p>I think that this process, of mixed and broken
reincarnation, may go on for countless generations—the
animal or animal-human souls so differentiated
from the race-soul returning continually
to the latter at death. But that a period
may come when the Race-self (illustrated by the
growing plant-stem) may exhibit distinct <i>buds</i>—the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_229' id='p_229'>229</a></span>
embryos, as it were, of independent souls—which
will not return and be lost again in the
race-soul, but will persevere for a long period and
continually attain to more differentiation and internal
coherence and sense of identity. In such
cases any reincarnations that occur connected with
these buds—though mingled with the race-life—will
become much less broken than before, and
more distinctly individual; till at last a phase is
reached when such a soul-bud, almost detached
from the race-life, may be reincarnated (or let
us say ‘re-embodied’) as a separate entity, with a
kind of immortality of its own.</p>

<p>It must be at this stage that the characteristic
human soul of the Civilization-period is evolved—which
coheres quite firmly round itself, which
protests and revolts against death, which even
largely throws off its allegiance to the race-soul,
and to the laws and solidarities of the race-life,
and which has an enormous and overweening
sense of identity and self-importance, claiming
for itself, as I have just said, a kind of separate
persistence. Here ensues, as may be imagined,
a terrible period of confusion and trouble—the
whole period of competitive civilization. The
splendid claim of identity and immortality is
made; but for the time being it is spoiled by
what we call ‘selfishness,’ the mirror is cracked
through ignorance. The Soul has disowned her
allegiance to mere instinct and the race-self, and
has yet not found a firm footing beyond—is only
floundering in the bogs of self-consciousness and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_230' id='p_230'>230</a></span>
anxiety. What kind of Re-embodiment may
belong to this period we shall best perhaps see
when we have considered the further course of
the argument.</p>

<p>For at last the process of transition completes
itself. The human soul tossed about beyond endurance
at length discovers within itself a divine
Nucleus—a nucleus of growth and life and refuge
and security, apart from its own fragility, quite
apart from the race-life, independent of all the
latter’s laws and conventions and sanctions and
traditions, independent of caste or color, of
world-period or locality; and from that moment
it (the soul) rests; it ceases (like the
little rose of Jericho) from its desert wanderings;
it radiates itself and begins to grow from
a new centre; it is born again; it becomes the beginning
of what may be called a Divine Soul.
The man becomes conscious of an ethereal body
forming within, unassailable or at least undestroyable
by Death; and it is probable that, during
this period, the subtle organism which we have
already termed the Inner or Spiritual Body
(ch. x.) <i>is</i> actually forming and defining and, so
to speak, consolidating itself. The subtle body of
a more perfect being is forming—a body which
can pass unharmed through walls, fire, water,
which can navigate the air and the planetary
spaces, and which is built on the basis of the ether,
itself the all-pervading life-substance of creation.
A divine soul is coming to expression, an <i>ego</i>
indeed, marvellously different and distinct from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_231' id='p_231'>231</a></span>
all other <i>egos</i>, and ever more majestic and unique
growing; but rooted deep in the universal self,
and ever from that root expanding and sharing
the life of that self and of all its children.</p>

<p>With the formation of this divine soul, re-embodiment
in its complete and adequate sense
commences. The spiritual or subtle body formed
within the gross body retains its characteristics
after the death of the latter (many of which
characteristics no doubt hardly gained expression
in the one life just ended)—and passes on to other
spheres, there to assume more or less definitely
material bodies according to the sphere and the
conditions in which it may need to move. It may
seek re-embodiment on earth through ordinary
heredity and childbirth—in which case presumably
it enters into the growing germ, and moulds
the development of the latter to an adequate,
if not to a quite perfect and unsullied, expression
of itself. If the reincarnation is to
be into ordinary human and terrestrial life, this
is probably the only available method. And it
would seem that some advanced and well-nigh
perfect souls do adopt this method, appearing
as infants with a kind of divinity about
them, and a germinal purity so great as to
seem to proceed from an ‘immaculate conception.’</p>

<p>But to most, in this stage, the toil and tedium
of passing through embryonic life and physical
birth and infancy may well appear intolerable;
and since by now they have developed the subtle
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_232' id='p_232'>232</a></span>
or spiritual body and the powers belonging to it,
this ordeal is no longer necessary. The subtle
body can—as we have gathered from former
chapters—by a process of condensation clothe
itself in a visible or even tangible vesture,<a id='r131'/><a href='#f131' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[131]</span></sup></a> and
may function, at any rate for a time, in such outer
or apparitional form without going through all
the <i>abracadabra</i> of birth. If on the earth, such
functioning can only be very temporary, owing
to the difficulty here of the conditions, and of
the supply of the necessary condensation-material;
but in other and less ponderous spheres the difficulty
is probably much less, and the formation
of suitable bodies comparatively easy. Anyhow,
it will be seen that reincarnation of this second
kind is unitary and single in character instead of
being divided or fragmentary; it is unalloyed instead
of being broken and mixed;<a id='r132'/><a href='#f132' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[132]</span></sup></a> and a vision
rises before us, in connection with it, of
ever-growing forms and more perfect life-embodiments
carrying out, one after another in
long succession, the evolution and expression of
each divine soul or separate ray of universal
being.</p>

<p>Thus in answer to query two, on an early page
of this chapter, we may say that there are two
kinds of reincarnation proper—quite different
from each other:—(1) That of the race-self
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_233' id='p_233'>233</a></span>
in which the individual members of the race share
only in a streaky fashion, each going back at death
into the race-soul, and emptying its memories and
experiences into that soul for general sporadic
inheritance, but not for transmission in mass to
any one later individual; and (2) that of the
individual who has found his divine soul and
evolved his inner body to a point where it cannot
be broken up again; and who is thus reincarnated
or re-embodied complete through successive
materializations or condensations, in other
spheres and without again undergoing the ordinary
race-birth and death.</p>

<p>But though these two represent the normal
forms of reincarnation, a third kind should be
added which represents the transition from one
to the other, and which is important for us because
it mainly covers the period in which we
now are—the great period of civilization. We
saw how the soul of the animal is so close to
the race-self, and so little differentiated from it,
that it probably returns quite easily into the race-self
at death; and this is likely to be the same
with very early or primitive man. But when the
distinctly human soul begins to form and to shape
itself, it does not so easily forget its individuality
and obliterate itself in that from which it sprang.
And so we have the tentative, half-formed human
soul, by no means well assured of itself, or
certain of its own powers, and by no means perfect
or contented, but much persuaded of its own
importance and anxiously seeking reincarnation
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_234' id='p_234'>234</a></span>
as a separate entity—and seeking this by
the only means available to it, <i>i.e.</i> through
heredity and birth as a member of the
race.</p>

<p>It is a painful situation and experience. The
soul, as human and not animal soul, is longing
to separate itself from the race, to mark its distinction
and independence—yet it has not, so far,
found the divine nucleus which alone can give it
real independence; and it can only gain expression
and manifestation through the race-self
and the ordinary paraphernalia of birth and
death. It has learned no other way. Moreover,
it is not yet completely differentiated from the
race-self. It thus arrives at what can only be
a very mingled and broken expression. Some
father-stream and some mother-stream uniting,
as it were, in the psychological neighborhood of
this half-formed soul give it the desired opportunity;
and blending itself with them it
comes down into the world—a being of triple
nature, embryonic and incompletely formed in itself,
and utilizing as best it can the diverse elements
of its maternal and paternal sources. Its
career, consequently, and its life on earth are
marked by a continual inner struggle and conflict—both
physiological and psychological (due
to the effort of the soul to bend the race-life and
the elements of corporeal heredity to its own
uses), and in strange contrast both with the
hardihood and calm insouciance of the animals,
in whom the race-life is untampered,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_235' id='p_235'>235</a></span>
and with the transparent health and serenity of
those other beings in whom the divine soul has
finally established its sovereignty.</p>

<p>Such, briefly described, are I believe the outlines
of the reincarnation story. To put it in a
few words, the whole process by which the race-self
evolves and finally gives birth to myriads
of free, independent and deathless individuals
curiously resembles and may well be illustrated
by a certain biological phenomenon common both
in the vegetable and the animal worlds. Some
growing stem or portion of tissue, perhaps of a
plant, perhaps of a sponge or higher organism,
is at first of a simple homogeneous character,
fairly uniform and undifferentiated: but after a
time it exhibits knobs and inequalities, which
presently define themselves in a sort of <i>botryoidal</i>
or clustered bud-like growth (as, for instance, in
the spadix of an arum or the ovary of a
mammal); finally these knobs or buds become
entirely distinct and fully formed, and are thrown
off ‘free,’ as seeds (in the case of plants and
animals), or gemmules (in the case of sponges),
or spores (in ferns and mosses), or as fresh and
complete individuals in many aquatic creatures—in
any case to enter on the beginnings of a free
and independent life of their own. This kind
of process, anyhow, is found in every department
of biology, and it may well be that it extends
upward even into the highest domains. The
growing stem—proliferating cells without number,
which are born and die in a kind of even
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_236' id='p_236'>236</a></span>
uniformity within the limits of the stem—corresponds
to the race-self in its early stages; the formation
of knobs and buds in various degrees of
clustered development corresponds to the partial
growth of human souls out of the race-soul; and
the liberation of the buds and germs corresponds
to the liberation of the human souls into the freedom
of a universal life.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_237' id='p_237'>237</a></span>
<h1 id='t7376'>CHAPTER XIII<br/>&ensp;<br/>THE DIVINE SOUL</h1>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> liberation of buds and germs, as in the biological
processes alluded to in the last chapter,
is in general connected with sex, and brought
about by its operation. And, similarly, I think
we may say that the liberation of human souls
and their disengagement from the race-matrix is
brought about by love. I have already pointed
out (ch. ix.) the intensely personal and individualizing
character of human love. If one can
imagine a love-relation going on between two
members of a race—two portions, as it were, of
the race-soul—at present only slightly individualized,
one can see how the attraction to each other,
the drawing away from their surroundings, the
excitement, the agitation, all tend to further their
growth as individuals—to give them form, apart
from the matrix in which they are embedded,
and definition and character. Of course all experience
does this, but most of all and most deeply
does love. It breeds souls out of the Race-self,
and finally brings them away to an independent
life. “It is for this that the body exercises
its tremendous attraction—that mortal love torments
and tears asunder the successive
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_238' id='p_238'>238</a></span>
generations of mankind—That underneath and after
all the true men and women may appear, by long
experience emancipated.”</p>

<p>As said in an early chapter, in love, though
we do not know exactly what is happening, we
are persuaded that something very profound and
far-reaching is working itself out. And one such
thing, I am sure, is the liberation of the soul of
the lover—and, in less degree, the soul of the
loved one. The tremendous experiences and convulsions,
the profound stirrings, and the wrenchings
from old ties and associations, do at last not
only build the soul up into a distinct individuality,
but they dig it up from its roots in the race
and plant it out in the great Eden garden
of emancipated humanity—the beginning of a
new career.<a id='r133'/><a href='#f133' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[133]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Another thing that I think is happening is
that when love is strongly reciprocated the
elements (as we have seen several times already),
whether physical or psychical, pass over from
one to the other and are interchanged—regenerating
and immensely enlarging the life and capacity
of each individual. This happens, I believe, in
all grades of the universal life, from the Protozoa
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_239' id='p_239'>239</a></span>
upwards. Two individuals drawn together interchange
some elements of their being, and grow
thereby into a larger and grander life; or may
even in cases fuse completely into one individual
person. As Swedenborg says somewhere:—“Those
who are truly married on earth are in
heaven one Angel.”</p>

<p>Thirdly, I think that the reciprocated love of
two sometimes creates a <i>new soul</i>. We are familiar
with the idea that the love (sexual)
of two bodies commonly creates a new body;
and there is an age-long tradition that the same is
true in the world of souls. There is in that
world also, not only regeneration but generation.
“Love is the desire of generation in the beautiful,
both <i>with relation to the soul and the body</i>,”
says Plato;<a id='r134'/><a href='#f134' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[134]</span></sup></a> and Ellen Key, in a passage already
quoted above (ch. iv., p. 61), says that “two
beings <i>through</i> one another may become a new
being, and a greater than either could be of itself
alone.” By love a new soul is sometimes generated
which takes possession of both persons,
and which suggests—as in the Swedenborg phrase
above—that in some other sphere they really become
one. And by love, we may also think, between
man and wife, a new soul or soul-bud is
sometimes created, which may descend into and
vivify the physical germ of their future child.</p>

<p>To consider this last point a moment. The
connection between heredity and the individual
self is very mysterious. We acknowledge our
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_240' id='p_240'>240</a></span>
descent, and what we owe, both mentally and
bodily, to our parentage; but we are fain to
think of our <i>ego</i> as something apart, something
not to be confused with parents, and by no means
merely derivative from them. Sometimes indeed
there is great harmony between this <i>ego</i>
and the parental inheritance, sometimes much the
reverse; sometimes the line between the two is
doubtful and uncertain. What is the explanation
of all this? and what are the true facts of the
relationship?</p>

<p>Does it not seem likely that, in the intense organic
excitement which attends sexual union, this
excitement—especially if strong love be also
present—reaches right down into the soul-depths
of each person, stirring these also, and the race
oversoul at that point, most profoundly? So that,
at the same moment that the germ of a bodily
child is being fertilized, there is formed
in the race-soul a soul-bud corresponding, which
consequently descends into the physical germ and
becomes its organizing life—the soul-bud thus
being related to the souls of the parents, somewhat
as the physical germ is related to their
bodies? It springs, in fact, from a related portion
of the race-oversoul.</p>

<p>Or again, does it not seem likely that in some
cases, instead of a quite new bud being formed,
the profound stirring of the race-life in that
vicinity causes some older and more developed
soul-bud—which has perhaps already had some
earth-experiences—to wake into activity and take
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_241' id='p_241'>241</a></span>
possession of the germ? In the first case mentioned
the child born will be singularly like the
parents, and in nature harmonious with them,
with very little extraneous in its character, and
with the fair prospect before it of a smooth and
even career. But in this latter case, though the
child will be harmonious with the parents it will
have great depths beside, of authentic character
of its own which will show out as time goes on.</p>

<p>And again, if deep love be absent, and consequently
there is no special birth or awakening of
souls in that region where they should be related
to the body which is being born—what is likely
to happen? Is it not likely that some other soul-bud,
or soul which chance or other indication of
destiny may bring that way, may enter in and possess
the developing organism? And is it not
likely, then, that strife and conflict and doubt may
also enter in, causing a character of mixed
elements, possibly leading to heroic developments,
but also probably to a broken or tragic life-story?</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>As in the earliest and most primitive developments
of life, so in the latest and most exalted,
the soul is born through love, and through love
it grows and expands. It may indeed be asked
whether any other way is possible. Oppositions
and conflicts may give form to the growing
thing, and help to carve its outlines; but this
gives it expansion. Every profound attachment
necessarily modifies and enlarges the man. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_242' id='p_242'>242</a></span>
pulls him out of his little orbit into a wider path—even
if for the moment with some amount of
eccentricity. Something is incorporated in his life
which was not part of it before—something possibly
which he did not before appreciate or understand.
What we now are—whether mentally or
physically—is an epitome of multitudinous loves
in the past. The very cell-alliances which constitute
our bodies are the records of endless heart-yearnings
and romances (dating from far-back
ages, and even now enduring) among a tiny people
to us well-nigh invisible. And we may ask
ourselves whether in the regions above and beyond
our present life there may not be soul-alliances
and even soul-fusions, by which we humans
in our turn build up the very life of the gods?
Plato in his <i>Symposium</i>, speaking of the strange
desire of lovers for each other, makes Aristophanes
say:<a id='r135'/><a href='#f135' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[135]</span></sup></a>—“But the soul of each manifestly
thirsts for, from the other, something which there
are no words to describe, and divines that
which it seeks, and traces obscurely the footsteps
of its obscure desire. If Vulcan should say
to persons thus affected, ‘My good people, what
is it that you want with one another?’ And if,
while they were hesitating what to answer, he
should proceed to ask—‘Do you not desire the
closest union and singleness to exist between you,
so that you may never be divided night or day?
If so, I will melt you together, and make you
grow into one, so that both in life and death ye
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_243' id='p_243'>243</a></span>
may be undivided. Consider, is this what you
desire? Will it content you if you become that
which I propose?’—We all know that no one
would refuse such an offer, but would at once
feel that this was what he had ever sought; and
intimately to mix and melt and to be melted together
with his beloved, so that one should be
made out of two.” And we may think—though
this strange and intimate longing is never fulfilled,
as we know, in the actual earth-life—that it still
may possibly be an indication (as happens in other
cases) of something which really is working itself
out in the unseen world.</p>

<p>It was suggested, in the end of chapter xi.
above, that limitation and hindrance are a part of
the cosmic scheme of the creation of souls, and
that there is a purpose in these things in regard
to this mortal life. It was also suggested that
the profound soul-stuff of which we are made is
capable of infinitely swifter and more extended
perceptions than those of which we are usually
aware; and that there is a good deal of evidence
to show that perceptive powers of this kind—quite
independent of the usual end-organs of sight,
hearing, taste, and so forth, still linger buried
deep down within us. The question then naturally
arises, If this limitation of faculty really
exists as a fundamental fact of our mortal life,
what purpose does it subserve?—And the answer
to this is, I think, very clear.</p>

<p>It subserves the evolution of Self-consciousness
and of the sense of Identity. It is obvious that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_244' id='p_244'>244</a></span>
diffused faculties and perceptions, however swift
and powerful, could never have brought these
gifts with them. It was only by pinning sensitiveness
down to a point in space and time, by
means of a body, and <i>limiting</i> its perceptions by
means of bodily end-organs, that these new values
could be added to creation—the local self and the
sense of Identity. All the variety of human
and animal nature, all the endless differences of
points of view, all diversity and charm of form
and character and temperament must be credited
to this principle; and whatever vagaries and delusions
the consequent growth of self-consciousness
and selfness may have caused, it is incontestable
that through the development of Identity
mankind and all creation must ultimately rise to a
height of glory and splendor otherwise unimaginable.</p>

<p>And not only limitation but also hindrance.
These things give an intensity and passion to life,
and a power and decisiveness to individuality, the
absence of which would indeed be sad. As a
water-conduit by limiting the spread of the stream
and confining it in a close channel gives it velocity
and force to drive the mill, so limitation and hindrance
in human life give the individualized
energy from which, for good or evil, all our
world-activities spring. As the Lord says in
Goethe’s Prologue to <i>Faust</i>:—</p>

<div class='poetry-container'><div class='lgp'>
<p class='line0'>“Of all the spirits of denial</p>
<p class='line0'>The mischief-maker I most tolerate,</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_245' id='p_245'>245</a></span></p>
<p class='line0'>For man’s activity doth all too soon unravel;</p>
<p class='line0'>Of slumber he seems never satiate;</p>
<p class='line0'>Therefore I gladly hand him to a mate</p>
<p class='line0'>Who’ll plague and prick, and play in fact the Devil.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Over a long period in this cosmic process this
action, we may think, goes on. The vast and
pervasive soul-stuff of the universe, in its hidden
way omniscient and omnipresent, suffers an obscuration
and a limitation, and is condensed into
a bodily prison in a point of space and time; but
with a consequent explosive energy incalculable.
The Devil—<i>diabolos</i> the slanderer and the sunderer,
the principle of division—reigns. To him,
the ‘milk and water’ heaven of universal but
vague benevolence is detestable. He builds up
the actual, fascinating, tragic, indispensable world
that we know. Selfishness and ignorance, the two
great Powers of discord and separation, are his
ministers; the earth is his theatre of convulsive
hatreds and soul-racking passion; and our mortal
life, instead of being the fair channel of cosmic
activities, becomes a “stricture knot,” as Whitman
calls it, and a symbol of disease.</p>

<p>But this diabolonian process is only one segment
of the whole. After the long descent and condensation
and imprisonment of the spirit in its
most limited and inert and self-regarding forms,
after its saturation in matter, and its banishment
in the world of death and suffering, the rising
curve of liberation sets in, and the long process of
its return. It is through love mainly, as we
have seen, that this second process works
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_246' id='p_246'>246</a></span>
itself out. From point to point through unison
with others, by absorbing something from their
experience, by sharing a wider life, the spirit’s
manifestation grows. By this the great tree of
organic life spreads upon the earth; by this each
race-stem multiplies its tissues and expands; by
this the buds of human souls are formed; and by
this the souls themselves are freed to independent
life, and ultimately to circle again “dancing and
sporting” as Plutarch says, “like joyous satellites
round about their sun in heaven.” There is continual
Transformation; but there is also continuity
from end to end. For every being there is
continuance, but continuance only by change.
Each soul is a gradual rising to consciousness
of the All-soul; a gradual liberation and
self-discovery of the divine germ within it.
First the race-soul rising toward this consciousness,
and then the individual souls thrown off,
rising each independently toward the same. It
is when the latter are moving over from their
(instinctive and so to speak organic) community
with the race-soul to a distinct and separate
knowledge of and allegiance to the divine germ
now declaring within themselves, that all this
period of confusion and dismay, naturally enough,
occurs—this that we have called the period of
Civilization and the Fall of man—the period in
which indeed we are now so fatefully involved.
But it is in this period too that ‘divine souls’
are formed, and their feet first set upon the
path of splendor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_247' id='p_247'>247</a></span>
Love indicates immortality. No sooner does
the human being perceive this divine nucleus within
himself than he knows his eternal destiny.
Plunged in matter and the gross body he has
learned the lesson of identity and separateness.
All that the devil can teach him he has faithfully
absorbed. Now he has to expand that identity,
for ever unique, into ever vaster spheres of
activity—to become finally a complete and finished
aspect of the One.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_248' id='p_248'>248</a></span>
<h1 id='t7712'>CHAPTER XIV<br/>&ensp;<br/>THE RETURN JOURNEY</h1>

<p><span class='sc'>We</span> have seen that there is some reason for believing
that, simultaneously with the birth or coming
to consciousness of what we have called the
divine soul, there occurs within us the formation
of a ‘spiritual’ or very subtly material body. This
body, if only composed of atoms, may easily be
so fine and subtle as to pass practically unchanged
through ordinary gross matter—the walls, for
instance, and other obstacles that surround us.
(At this moment there is an astronomical
theory current that the stellar universe consists
of two vast star-systems which are passing in
nearly opposite directions right <i>through each
other</i>.) If composed of electrons its subtlety and
pervasive powers must be much greater. Moreover,
its fineness and subtlety would make it difficult
of destruction. The ordinary agents of
death—physical violence, water, fire, and so forth—would,
as already pointed out, hardly reach it;
and it is easy to suppose that it might continue
onwards and perdure in stability and activity for
thousands of years. Even the Atom of matter,
which is now regarded as a complex system of
electrons, is supposed to have an immensely
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_249' id='p_249'>249</a></span>
extended lifetime—nearly two thousand years in the
case of Radium, and much longer in the case of
all other substances; and if two thousand
years or thereabouts is the minimum lifetime
of an atom, it is not difficult to suppose that the
lifetime of a subtle body composed as above
described may be equally or much more extended.</p>

<p>During its lifetime, the radio-active atom,
slowly disintegrating, pours out a prodigious
amount of energy; and in the process apparently
is transformed and takes on other characters and
qualities. Radium for instance, or rather some
products of its disintegration, are thought to take
on the characters of Helium and of Lead. And
similarly we have every reason to believe that the
subtle body of Man is continually pouring out
energy on all sides, radiating like a sun—pouring
out mental states, sensible forms, influences
of all kinds, even images of itself, and so continually
entering into a wider life and touch with
others, and undergoing a slow transformation
of its outer form. At the same time—and leading
to the same results—it is continually storing
up in its recesses impressions and memories for
the seed of future expression and development.</p>

<p>It may be imagined that the gross terrestrial
body—though splendidly necessary for the localizing
of the Self, and the establishment of the
sense of identity, and for the electric accumulation
of stores of emotion and passion, and so forth—acts
on the whole in such a way as to greatly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_250' id='p_250'>250</a></span>
hamper and limit the activities of the inner body;
and we can imagine that (as at death and under
other special conditions) the liberation from the
gross body is naturally accompanied by an enormous
extension of faculty. The soul in its new
and subtler form passes out into an immensely
wider sphere of action and perception—so much
so, indeed, as to make direct converse between the
two worlds (the new world it is in, and the old
one it has left) difficult to establish and very difficult
permanently to maintain. The author of
<i>Interwoven</i> says (p. 221) that the first body and
the second body differ greatly in their chemical
particles, “and so the same degree of sight and
hearing is not possible.... <i>We</i> have just as
much trouble to see the outsides of things as mortals
have to see the insides.”</p>

<p>Nor can we place a necessary limit to the birth
of finer bodies. There may be a succession of
such things. The electron brings us very near
to a <i>mental</i> state; for whereas an Atom—conceived
as similar to the speck of dust which one
can roll between one’s fingers, only much more
minute—seems to have no relation to mentality,
a tiny electric charge, capable of conveying
a <i>shock</i>, comes very close! And at that stage
the truth becomes apparent that the inner intelligent
being in all things is the core, and the
body is only the surface of contact—the surface,
in fact, along which one intelligence administers
shocks to another! With liberation
from the gross body that surface may grow
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_251' id='p_251'>251</a></span>
enormously extended, and it may become possible
to <i>touch</i> or <i>see</i>, or to render oneself visible or
tangible, to others far beyond all ordinary possibilities
of contact or perception.</p>

<p>The succession of finer bodies may exist in any
gradation, from what we call gross matter to the
subtlest ether of emotion. At any rate we can see
that at every stage there will be a finer body which
is <i>more</i> of the nature of thought, and an outer
and coarser which is less so. As the gifted author
of <i>The Science of Peace</i>, Bhagavan Das, says:—“At
each stage the Jiva-core (<i>i.e.</i> the core of
the living individual) consists of matter of the
inner plane, while its outer upâdhi (or sheath)
consists of matter of the outer plane; and when
a person says, I think, I act, it means that the
matter of the inner core, which is the I, for the
time being, is actually, positively, modified by,
or is itself modifying in a certain manner, the
outer real world.” The inner film of matter (or
mind), as he says, “is posing and masquerading,
for the time being, as the truly immaterial
self.”</p>

<p>This central Self we can never <i>wholly</i> reach,
but the movement of each divine soul is toward
it; and the assurance and salvation of each soul
is in the growing sense of union with it. The
personal self can only ‘survive’ by ever fading and
changing toward the universal. Our inner
identity is fixed, but our outward identity we
can only preserve by, as it were, forever
losing it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_252' id='p_252'>252</a></span>
After life’s fitful fever—after the insurgence
and resurgence of passions; after the heart-breaking
struggles which are forced upon some for the
sake of a mere material footing upon the earth;
after the deadly sufferings which others must
undergo in order to gain scantiest allowance and
expression of their inner and spiritual selves;
after the mortal conflict and irreconcilableness of
material and mental needs; the battles with
opponents, the betrayal of friends, the fading and
souring of pleasures, and the dissipation of ideals—the
consent of mankind goes to affirm and confirm
the conclusion that sleep is well, sleep is desirable.
As after a hard day’s labor, when the
sinews are torn and the mind is racked, Nature’s
soft nurse commends a period of rest and healing—so
it would seem fitting that a similar period
should follow, for the human soul, on the toil and
the dislocation of life.</p>

<p>It seems indeed probable—and a long tradition
confirms the idea—that the human soul at death
does at first pass, with its cloud-vesture of
memories and qualities, into some intermediate
region, <i>astral</i> rather than <i>celestial</i> (if we may use
words which we do not understand), some Purgatory
or Hades, rather than Paradise or
Olympus; and for a long period does remain
there quiescent, surveying its past, recovering
from the shocks and outrages of mortal experience,
knitting up and smoothing out the broken
and tangled threads, trying hard to understand
the pattern. It seems probable that there is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_253' id='p_253'>253</a></span>
long period of such digestion and reconcilement
and slow brooding over the new life which has to
be formed. Indeed when one comes to think of
it, it seems difficult—if there is to be continuance
at all—to imagine anything else. When one
thinks of the strange contradictions of our mortal
life, the hopelessly antagonistic elements, the warring
of passions, the shattering of ideals, the
stupor of monotony: the soul like a bird shut in
a cage, or with bright wings draggled in the mire;
the horrible sense of sin which torments some
people, the mad impulses which tyrannize over
others; the alternations of one’s own personality
on different days, or at different depths and planes
of consciousness; the supraliminal and the subliminal;
the smug Upper-self with its petty satisfactions
and its precise and precious logic, and
the great Under-self now rising (in the hour of
death) like some vast shadowy figure or genius,
out of the abyss of being—when one thinks of
all this one feels that if there is to be any sanity
or sequence in the conclusion, it must mean a long
period of brooding and reconciliation, and of readjustment,
and even of sleep.</p>

<p>At first it may well be a troubled period, of
nightmare-like confusion; but at last there must
come a time when harmony is restored. The past
lifetime is spread out like a map before one—all
its events fall into their places, composed and
clear. The genius, rising from the depths, throws
a strange light upon them. “This was necessary.
That could not have been otherwise. And that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_254' id='p_254'>254</a></span>
again which seemed so fatal, do you not now
see its profound meaning?” The soul surveying
gradually redeems the past. It comes to
understand. <i>Tout comprendre, c’est tout pardonner.</i>
It beholds, far down, the little fugitive
among the shadows, pursued by the hideous and
imbecile mask—the sense of Sin—and, recognizing
a fleeting embodiment of itself, it smiles: for
that mask has been seen through and is useless
any longer. It beholds another—or is it the
same?—pursued by the Terror of Death; and
again it smiles: for <i>that</i> shadow—like the vast
moonshadow in a total eclipse of the sun, which
seemed so solid and all-devouring, has swept by;
it has been passed through, and it was only a
shadow.</p>

<p>And it may well be also that this whole process
of reconciliation and adjustment and the building
up of diverse elements into one harmonious being
may occupy more than one such interval between
two lifetimes; it may require several periods of
incubation, so to speak. Looking at the matter
from the physical side, and seeing how the inner
and subtle body has probably to be formed during
all this time—as in a chrysalis—and differentiated
into an independent life, it seems likely
that several intervals of outer rest and inner
growth may be needed, and a series of successive
moultings! But in the end, when the string of
earth-lives is finished, and the reconciliation is
complete, then the essential, the divine, self has
become manifest, and is ready for a whole new
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_255' id='p_255'>255</a></span>
world, a new order of experience, even to the

<p>I have suggested in a former chapter that
Memory—that very wonderful faculty—is probably
our best test of Identity, our best test of
Survival. If we apply this canon to the evolution
of the independent soul out of the race-life, it
may help us. When an animal dies, the group
of memories, which is its life’s-experience, probably
passes back and is transmitted in a more or
less diffused way into the general race-life or
soul.<a id='r136'/><a href='#f136' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[136]</span></sup></a> In the case of some higher animals it is
possible that the memory-group thus returning
may cohere for a time or to a certain degree, and
not be immediately diffused. In the case of the
higher types of <i>Man</i> it is probable that such
group may cohere for a long time and rather persistently;
and though embedded in the general
race-life and memory, and much mingled with and
modified by these, it may still form to some degree
an independent centre of intelligence and organization
(something like a nerve-plexus in the
brain or body). It will form, in fact, what I have
already called a soul-bud or budding soul, and
will be capable of that mixed or partial reincarnation
of which I have spoken—in which some
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_256' id='p_256'>256</a></span>
truly individual streaks of memory will be mixed
with general memories of race-life.</p>

<p>But after each successive reincarnation the
group of memories returning—and allying themselves
to the former groups—will necessarily give
more and more definition to such budding soul,
till at last the time will come when its individuality
will be complete; its severance from the race-life
will follow as a matter of course; and it will
float out into the sea of the all-pervading and
divine consciousness.</p>

<p>During this budding period of the human soul,
which generally speaking may be said to coincide
with the civilization-period of human history,
the memory of each earth-life will go back
into the race-soul there to swell the nucleus of
the individual soul which is being brought to
birth; but it will not generally revive into <i>evidence</i>
in the next earth-life, for, being so deeply
buried within, it will be too much overlaid by
external layers and happenings to come distinctly
into consciousness. It is not probably till the
completion of the whole series of its earth-lives
that the soul will resume all these memories and
come into its complete heritage. Then, at some
deep stage or state all its incarnations (clarified
and comprehended) will become manifest to it—a
glorious kingdom beyond the imagination of
man at present to conceive. All its various lives
it may live over again; but with as much difference
in its understanding of their meaning as
there is between an accomplished player’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_257' id='p_257'>257</a></span>
rendering of a piece of music, and a child’s first stumbling
performance of the same.</p>

<p>It will perceive that, in a sense, it has <i>pre-existed</i>
from eternity. For though certainly there
was a time when it first sprang as a bud from the
Race, and entered into a gradually evolving and
self-defining series of personal lives, yet that first
bud was itself but a particular limitation and
condensation of the Race-self; and <i>that</i> again,
far back and beyond, a limitation through many
intermediate stages of the All-self. It (the
human-divine soul) will perceive that it pre-existed
from eternity as the All-self; that it suffered
in its time the necessary obscurations and
limitations; that it abdicated the high prerogative
of universal consciousness; and that it was born
again as a tiny Cinderella-spark; destined to rise
through all the circles of personal and individual
life, and the enacting of the great drama of
Love and Death—the great cycle of Evolution
and Transfiguration—once more to the eternal
Throne.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>The glory of that Heaven where the All-self
dwells radiant as the Sun, and each lesser or
partial soul knows itself as a ray conveying the
whole light, but in a direction of its own—we
need not dwell on or attempt to portray. As
the emancipated soul, just described, may include
the personalities of many earth-lives and bodies,
so there may be—probably are—larger inclusive
selves, special gods, having troops of souls united
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_258' id='p_258'>258</a></span>
to them in the bonds of love and devotion.
Telepathic radiations, travelling as it were on
lines of light, and with the velocity and directness
of light, bring each unit into possible touch
with every other, and over an enormous field.
As the modern theory of electricity supposes that
every electric charge, however small, or associated
with the smallest atom, is connected by lines
of force with some other and complementary
charge <i>somewhere</i>—even perhaps at a practically
infinite distance—negative with positive, and positive
with negative; so the idea is suggested that in
the free world of the spirit every need felt by
one atom of personality anywhere is felt also and
answered to by some complementary impulse and
personality <i>somewhere</i>. In the bringing together
of these needs and affections, in the recovery and
the building up and the presentation in sensible
form of all the worlds of memory,
slumber infinite possibilities, and the outlines of
endless situations and developments. The individual
is clearly not lost in any ‘Happy Mass’;
but may contribute to the formation of such a
thing in the sense that he comes into such wide
and extended touch with others as to have a
practically unlimited range of experience, memory,
knowledge, creative power, and so forth, to
draw on.</p>

<p>Nor is there any call to think of a <i>bodiless</i>
heaven or bodiless state of being in any plane of
existence. The body in any stage or state is,
I repeat, a surface of contact. Wherever one
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_259' id='p_259'>259</a></span>
intelligent being comes into touch with another—whether
actively, by impressing itself on the
other, or passively by being impressed—there
immediately arises a body. There arises the
sense of matter, which is in fact the <i>impression</i>
made by one being upon another. The external
senses, of sight, hearing and the rest, are modifications
or limitations of more extended inner
faculties, of vision, audition, and so forth. The
actual world of Nature which we know, in the
bodies of the woods and streams, and of animals
and men, is built up out of the material of our
senses; out of the kind of impressionability of
which our senses are susceptible; but if these
materials, of our sight and hearing and touch
and taste, were altered but slightly in their range,
the whole world would be different. They would
create for us another world. And so, if
these present end-organs of sense were destroyed,
the soul, furnished with the inner faculties corresponding,
would create another world of sense
and of Nature, which would become the medium
of expression and communication on that new
plane, and the material of its bodily manifestation
there. At present, owing to entanglement
in the grosser senses, life is certainly
in the main a matter of food and drink, of sex,
of money-making, and the exercise of rather rude
recreations and arts. With a finer range of
sense, there would still remain the roots and realities
of these things; the need of sustenance would
still survive in the finer body, and the need
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_260' id='p_260'>260</a></span>
of interchange and the indrawing of vitality; the
hunger of union and of intercourse would remain—to
be expressed in some shape or other; the
delight in music and in beauty of form would
be no less, though sounds and colors might be
different from those we know; and all the faculties
that we have—and others too that are
now only embryonic with us—would demand their
exercise and expression. Out of such demands
and needs would arise a corresponding world.</p>

<p>I have suggested above (ch. xi.) how, deep in
the subliminal self, there lies a marvellous faculty
of producing visible and audible phenomena—Visions
and Voices and Forms. Out of the
depths of being these can be evoked, and bodied
forth into the actual world.<a id='r137'/><a href='#f137' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[137]</span></sup></a> In other words, each
such Self, in its moods of power, can call forth its
own thoughts and mental images with such force
as to impress them irresistibly on others within its
range—with such force, in fact, as to give them a
material vesture and location. What we have
said of the vastness and range of the human Under-self,
of its swift interrelation with others, of
the immensity of its memory extending far back
into the deeps of time, must convince us that its
powers of creation must be correspondingly wonderful.
The phenomena exhibited by entranced
mediums, and by hypnotized subjects, are only a
sample of these powers; but they hint dimly to
us that when we understand ourselves, and what
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_261' id='p_261'>261</a></span>
we are, and when we understand others, and what
they are, Time and Space and Estrangement will
no longer avail against us; they will no longer
hinder us from recognition of each other, nor
hold us back from the spheres to which we truly
belong, and the fulfilment of our real needs and
desires.</p>

<p>Man is the Magician who whether in dreams
or in trance or in actual life can, if he wills it,
raise up and give reality to the forms of his desire
and his love. It is not necessary for us feverishly
to pursue our loved ones through all the fading
and dissolving outlines of their future or their
past embodiments. They are ours already, in the
deepest sense—and one day we shall wake up to
know we can call them at any moment to our
side; we shall wake up to know that they are
ever present and able to manifest themselves to
us out of the unseen.</p>

<h1 id='t8159'>CHAPTER XV<br/>&ensp;<br/>THE MYSTERY OF PERSONALITY</h1>

<p><span class='sc'>It</span> will have been noticed that throughout this
book there has been a tendency to return again
and again to the question of what we mean by
the Self. As I have said before (see ch. xii.,
<i>supra</i>), one might very naturally suppose that as
the <i>ego</i> underruns all experience, and we cannot
make any observation of the world at all except
through its activity, the general problem of the
nature of the ego would be the first to be attacked,
and the very first to be solved; whereas,
curiously enough, it seems to be the last! Only
towards the conclusion of philosophical speculation
does the importance of this problem force itself
on men’s minds. Nevertheless, I think we may
say that in the department of philosophy it is the
great main problem which lies before this age for
solution; and that one of the greatest services a
man can do is—by psychologic study and manifold
experience, by poetical expression, especially
in lyrical form, and by philosophic thought and
investigation—to make clear to himself and the
world what he means by the letter ‘I,’ what he
means by his ‘self.’</p>

<p>To the unthinking person nothing seems
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_263' id='p_263'>263</a></span>
simpler, more obvious, than his own existence—and
hardly needing definition. Yet the least
thought shows how complex and elusive this ‘self’
is. It is one of those cases with which the world
teems—a juggle of the open daylight—in
which an object <i>appears</i> so perfectly simple,
frank, innocent, and without concealment, and yet
is really profoundly complex, deliberate, and unfathomable.</p>

<p>The most elementary considerations easily illustrate
what I mean.<a id='r138'/><a href='#f138' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[138]</span></sup></a> When we speak of the
ego, do we mean the self of to-day, or of yesterday,
or of some years back—or possibly some
years in the future when we shall have found the
expression now unhappily denied us? Do we
mean the self of boyhood, or even of babyhood?
or do we mean that of maturity, or of old age?
Do we mean the self indicated by the mind alone,
or by the spirit, apart from the body? or do we
mean that indicated specially by the body, or even
(as some folk seem to consider) by the <i>clothes</i>?
It would be very puzzling to be asked to place
one’s finger, so to speak, on any one of these
manifestations as really and completely representative.
Rather perhaps we should be inclined,
if pressed, to say that our real self was something
underrunning <i>all</i> these forms—that it required
all the expressions, from infancy, through maturity,
even to old age, and all the apparatus of
body and mind, in order to convey its meaning;
and that to pin it down to any particular moment
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_264' id='p_264'>264</a></span>
of time, or to any particular phase of the material
or spiritual, would be to do it a great injustice.</p>

<p>If so, we seem at once compelled to think of
the Self as something greatly larger than any
ordinary form of it that we know, as something
perhaps on a different plane of being—underrunning,
and therefore in a sense beyond, Time;
and similarly underrunning, and therefore in a
sense beyond, both body and mind. And this
all the more, because, as I have said on an earlier
page, we all feel that at best much of our real
selves remains in life-long defect of expression;
and that there are great deeps of the Under-self
(as in chapter viii.) which, though organically related
to our ordinary consciousness, are still for
the most part hidden and unexplored. All, in
fact, points to the existence within us of a very
profound self, which so far we may justifiably
conclude to be much greater than any one known
manifestation of it; which requires for its expression
the forms of a lifetime; and still stretches on
and beyond; which perhaps belongs to another
sphere of being—as the ship in the air and the
sunlight belongs to another sphere than the hull
buried deep in the water.</p>

<p>But we may go further in our exploration of
the “abysmal deeps.” We have once or twice
in the foregoing chapters alluded to the possibility
of the self dividing into two personalities,
or even more. We have supposed, for instance,
that at death the psychic organism may possibly
split up—some more terrestrial portion remaining
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_265' id='p_265'>265</a></span>
operant and active on the earth-plane, and some
other portion removing to a subtler and more
ethereal region. Are we—we may ask—and
those others who propound the same ideas
talking nonsense in doing so? Is it anyhow possible
for a self to be active in two bodies or
in two places at the same time? It may indeed
seem impossible and absurd—until we envisage
the actual facts; but when we do so, when we
study the facts of the alternation of personalities,
so much in evidence at the present time, when
we find that two or more personalities, or
coherent bodies of consciousness, may not only
succeed each other in one human organism, but
may <i>simultaneously</i> be active in the same,<a id='r139'/><a href='#f139' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[139]</span></sup></a> when
we find that there is such a thing as ‘bilocation,’
and that the apparition of a person may come
and deliver a message while the original person
is far away and otherwise engaged, when we notice
carefully our own internal psychology and
find that we not unfrequently “talk to ourselves”
and in other ways behave as two persons in
one body—we see that the absurdity or unlikelihood
of the suggestion may not by any
means be so great as supposed, and that we may
after all be forced to largely remodel our conception
of what Personality is.<a id='r140'/><a href='#f140' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[140]</span></sup></a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_266' id='p_266'>266</a></span>
That one Personality should divide into two
or more may seem to be foreign to our habitual
views; yet we must remember that worms, annelids,
and molluscs of various kinds commonly so
divide; and though it is puzzling to think what becomes
of the ‘I’ or ‘self’ of a sea-anemone when
the latter is cut in twain and each part goes its
way as a new creature, we must not therefore
refuse to envisage the fact and the problem thus
flowing from it. As to the Protozoa, which
certainly exhibit signs of considerable intelligence,
<i>fission</i> of one cell into two or more
is one of the most normal and frequent events
of their lives. The same, of course, is true
of the elementary cells of the human body;
the fission even of whole organs of the body is
not uncommon, though more pathological in character;
and the fission of the personality, as just
mentioned, is quite frequent; and in some cases—as
in the well-known case of Sally Beauchamp—very
striking, on account of the furious apparent
opposition developed between one portion and
another.<a id='r141'/><a href='#f141' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[141]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>The conception therefore of Personality must,
it would seem, include the thought of possible
bilocation—that is, of possible manifestation in
two places at the same time; and it must not
refuse the thought of inclusion—<i>i.e.</i> of one personality
being possibly included within another—as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_267' id='p_267'>267</a></span>
of living and intelligent cells within the
body.<a id='r142'/><a href='#f142' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[142]</span></sup></a> Furthermore, we must not only allow
<i>division</i> of self as one of the attributes of personality,
but also, apparently, <i>fusion</i> with other
selves. This may seem far-fetched and unreasonable
at first, but on consideration we
cannot but see that in one degree or another it
is quite in the order of Nature. The Protozoa,
of course, quite frequently combine with each
other, and so make a new start in life; in the
higher organisms the sperm-cell and germ-cell
fuse completely for the conception of the offspring,
and the organisms themselves fuse partially
and interchange elements during the process
of conjunction; and in the psychology of love
among human beings we notice a similar fusion,
and sometimes also almost a confusion, of personalities.</p>

<p>The little self-conscious mind (of the civilized
man) no doubt protests against all this. It desires
to think of itself as a separate and definite
entity, distinct from (and perhaps superior to)
all others; and it finds any theories of possible
fission or fusion of personalities quite baffling and
impracticable. Yet in the light of the All-self—the
key-thought of this book—the whole thing is
obvious, and there is really no difficulty, except
perhaps in the linking up (through memory) of
the continuity of each lesser self.</p>

<p>What we said in the last chapter, namely that
“the personal self-consciousness can only survive
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_268' id='p_268'>268</a></span>
by ever fading and changing toward the universal,”
must be borne in mind. Continual <i>expansion</i>
is a normal condition of consciousness.
Time is an integral element of it.<a id='r143'/><a href='#f143' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[143]</span></sup></a> Consciousness
must continually grow. Through memory it preserves
the past, through the present it adds
to its stores. The author of <i>The Science of Peace</i>
illustrates the subject (p. 303) by asking us to
consider the spheres of consciousness of various
officials in a country whose departments more
or less overlap each other: “There are administrative
officers in charge of each department,
whose consciousness may be said to include the
consciousness of their subordinates in that department,
to exclude those of their compeers, and to
be in turn included in those of their superiors.
The more complicated the machinery of the
government, the better the illustration will be
of inclusions and exclusions and partial or
complete coincidences, and overlappings and
communions of consciousness. At last we come
to the head of the government, whose consciousness
may be said to include the consciousnesses,
whose knowledge and power include the knowledges
and powers of all the public servants in
the land, and whose consciousness is so expanded
as to enable him to be in touch with them all and
feel and act through them all constantly. An
officer promoted through the grades of such an
administration would clearly pass through expansions
of consciousness.... Such expansion
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_269' id='p_269'>269</a></span>
of consciousness, then, is not in its nature more
mysterious and recondite than any other item
in the world-process, but a thing of daily and
hourly occurrence. In terms of metaphysic it
is the coming of an individual Self into relation
with a larger and larger not-self.”</p>

<p>In the light of the All-self, I say, the difficulties
disappear. It is the question of Memory (explicit
or implicit) which seems to decide the limits
of personalities and their survival. The One
Self is experiencing in all forms, but the stores
of experience and memory are kept separate.
Here is a man who has a Town house and a
Country house and an Italian villa. When he
changes his abode from one to the other he
becomes to a great extent a different person.
His surroundings and associations, his pursuits
and occupations, his dress and habits, his language
may be, are changed. It may even happen that
each of his three lives goes on growing and expanding
after its own pattern, and becoming more
and more different from the two others; and yet
the ultimate person behind them all remains the
same. Is it not possible that the lives of us human
beings may go on expanding and growing
each according to its own law, and yet the ultimate
individual or Being behind them all may
remain the same?</p>

<p>If a worm be supposed to have memory (and
worms no doubt have memory in some degree),
then it might well be supposed that, if divided
in two, each of the parts would inherit the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_270' id='p_270'>270</a></span>
said memory complete. But from that moment
the experiences of the two portions, moving in
different directions, would bifurcate, and the future
stores of memory would be different. Thus
we should have a bifurcation of the stream of
memory, and a bifurcation of personality—until
ultimately, as time went on, and the common
memory faded into the background, the two new
personalities would begin to feel themselves
almost quite separate. Is not this again something
like what may have happened to ourselves
from Creation’s birth? The stream of life has
bifurcated and bifurcated till we have lost our
common memory and have become convinced of
the absolute separation of our personalities one
from the other.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the conjunction and fusion
of two streams of memory in one is as probable
and intelligible as the bifurcation of one into two.
Two protozoa fuse; but the race-self in one
is the same as in the other, and in reality the
process is only a fusion of organic memories
and experiences. A man who had been in the
habit of changing every year from his Town to
his Country house might some day find it
convenient to combine his establishments in one
suburban residence. Certainly if he had so far
forgot <i>himself</i> that in changing houses he had
always <i>quite</i> changed his memories, then it would
seem impossible to him to combine the two lives
in one. Otherwise there would be no difficulty
in the process. The stores of one establishment,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_271' id='p_271'>271</a></span>
with their associations and memories would after
a time (and not without some maturation-divisions
and extrusions!) be got into relation with
the stores of the other establishment; and the two
bodies of memory and association would settle
down together.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>All this seems to suggest to us that our conception
of personality must be considerably altered
from its ordinary form, and rendered more
fluent, in order to tally with the real facts. There
is no such thing as a fixed and limited personality,
of definite content and character, which we can
credit to our account, or to the account of our
friends. All is in flux and change, the consciousness
ever enlarging, the <i>ego</i> which is at the root
of that consciousness ever growing in the knowledge
of itself as a vital portion of the All-self.
That last alone is fixed; that alone as the ‘universal
witness’ is permanent. But the streams of
memory and experience, by which from all sides
that central fact and consciousness is reached, are
infinite in number and variety. It is in the continuity
of a stream of memory that what we call
personality must be supposed to consist; and
when this continuity covers not only a single life,
but extends from life to life, then we must find
a new name for the persistent being and call him
not a personality, but, if we will, an <i>individuality</i>.
Such individualities must exist by millions and
billions; they must be as numerous as all the
possible lines of experience (and these are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_272' id='p_272'>272</a></span>
quasi-infinite in number) by which the soul may
grow from its birth in the simplest speck of
matter to its realization of divine and universal
life. The author (Bhagavan Das) of <i>The Science
of Peace</i> illustrates this infinitude of individualities,
and how they are all contained in the
All-self, and each in a sense as an aspect of the
One, by the simile of a museum or gallery. “If
a spectator,” he says (p. 289), “wondered unrestingly
through the halls of a vast museum or
great art gallery, at the dead of night, with a single
small lamp in one hand, each of the natural
objects, the pictured scenes, the statues, the
portraits, would be illumined by that lamp in
succession for a single moment, while all the
rest were in darkness, and after that single
moment would fall into darkness again. Let
there now be not one but countless such spectators,
as many in endless numbers as the objects of
sight within the place, each spectator wandering
in and out incessantly through the great crowd
of all the others, each lamp bringing momentarily
into light one object, and for only that spectator
who holds that lamp.” Then he goes on to
say that each line or succession of experiences
might represent an individuality; each individuality
in the end would reach the totality of
experience, but in a different order and in a
different manner from any other; and all the
individualities would all the time—though changing
themselves—remain within the unchanging
intelligence of the absolute, and would only be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_273' id='p_273'>273</a></span>
exploring that intelligence each in a different order.
“For,” he again says (p. 317), “an individuality
can no otherwise be described, discriminated and
fixed, than by enumerating the experiences of that
individual, by narrating its biography.”</p>

<p>We may also illustrate the matter by the conception
of a Tree. A single leaf at the end of
a twig may seem to have a little separate self of
its own; but it is very ephemeral. It perishes
with the season and another leaf takes its place.
There is a deeper self, in the twig, which endures,
and from which new leaves spring. And again
the twig springs from a small spray, which is the
source of other twigs and leaves. Should the leaf
desire to trace its complete and total self it would
have to follow its life-line through the twig and
the spray, to the branch, and so right down to
the central trunk. It could not stop at any halfway
point, and say, This is my final self. But
on its way to the trunk, at different points, it
would find that its sap or life was flowing into
other twigs and leaves, as well as the twig and
leaf first mentioned. It would come into relation,
so to speak, with other bodies beside the first.
If we were to call the first leaf and twig a personality
we should have to call some deeper self
involving many twigs and leaves an Individuality,
and so on to the All-self of the tree. The self
of every leaf would approach the main trunk
along a different line, and through various ranges
of individuality; but all would ultimately participate
in one whole.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='p_274' id='p_274'>274</a></span>
I think some such view is clearly the most
satisfactory way of looking at the matter. We
are all essentially one; our differentiation from
each other does not consist in differences in the
central ego, but in the different lines of experience
and memory. We can none of us boast, at any
point, of a rounded, definite and stationary self,
apart from all others; but we are all approaching
the universal from different sides. Yet, also, it
is perfectly true that consciousness is born in us
first <i>through</i> our very limitations. Through the
very obstacles that surround us, and through the
things that seem to divide us from others, first
simple consciousness and then self-consciousness
are born. Then comes a time when the limitations
and the barriers become intolerable. The
soul that at first gloried in them comes to find
the burden of self-consciousness too great. Why
should it be forever John Smith? As Mrs. Stetson
says:—</p>

<div class='poetry-container'><div class='lgp'>
<p class='line0'>“What an exceeding rest ’twill be</p>
<p class='line0'>When I can leave off being Me!...</p>
<p class='line0'>Done with the varying distress</p>
<p class='line0'>Of retroactive consciousness!...</p>
<p class='line0'>Why should I long to have John Smith</p>
<p class='line0'>Eternally to struggle with?”</p>
</div></div>

<p>When the consciousness arises of this fact, that
we need not be tied to John Smith forever—that
our real self is far vaster, and essentially one with
others, then in each of us the Divine Soul is born;
a vista of glory and splendor opens in front, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_275' id='p_275'>275</a></span>
on all sides the barriers fall to the ground. On
the way to this supreme conclusion the stream of
memories which one calls oneself may of course
take on form after form; it may bifurcate, or it
may fuse with other streams. That does not very
much matter. The real identity, once established,
can hardly be lost. For every leaf there is a channel
of sap which connects it with the main trunk.
Personality is real, but it yields itself up in the
greater Individual of which it is the expression;
and the individual or divine soul is real—enduring
perhaps many thousands of years—but it yields
itself up ultimately in the All. Finally, in that
union, Memory itself, in its mortal form, ceases,
for it is swallowed up in actual realization, in the
power of actual presence in all space and time.
The divine soul which has thus completed its
union needs memory no more. It is there wherever
it desires to be. As the author of <i>Siderische
Geburt</i> (Berlin, 1910) says, “We mortals are
separated from the divine all-embracing universal
Vision; and Memory is only a first glimmering reawakening—a
beginning of renewed seraphic life
and a coming into relation with all that lies beyond
the little world-corner of our presence.”<a id='r144'/><a href='#f144' class='fn'><sup><span class='fn'>[144]</span></sup></a></p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>At first sight, and to one who does not yet
realize the inner unity of being, these views on
the nature of Personality and Individuality may
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_276' id='p_276'>276</a></span>
appear strange and even painful. For such a
person the thought of the dissociation of his
‘self,’ of its separation into two or more parts—either
in life or in death—and the divergence of
the two parts from each other, must be grotesque
and terrible, and verging even towards madness.
And so also must be the thought of the possible
dissociation of the personalities of his friends.
And yet it may be necessary for us at length and
by degrees to understand and assimilate such a
view. Certain it is that, as we come to understand
it, we shall see that any dissociation that
may occur can only be of the superficial elements—something
of the nature of a divergence of the
chains of memory; and that dissociation of the
real and intimate self is a thing quite impossible.
We shall see that by degrees the self may learn
to deal with such dissociations, and to express
itself in various guises, and in more than one
personality at a time. If, for instance, there
does occur at death a certain break-up of the
psychic organism—if the animal soul, and the
human soul, and the divine soul do to a certain
extent part from each other and go along different
ways, we may see that it is quite possible that
the personal stream of memory may correspondingly
branch in different directions. One portion
of the consciousness, having always been animal
and terrestrial in character, may identify itself
mainly with the animal vitality of the residue and
its corresponding memories—and may persevere
for some time as a wandering passional centre,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_277' id='p_277'>277</a></span>
liable to attach itself to the organisms of living
folk, or to figure as a ‘ghost’ of very limited
activities and occupied with eternal repetitions of
the same action; another portion, more distinctly
human, may linger in some intermediate state,
partly in touch with the earth-life and the souls
of mortal friends, yet partly drawn onward into
wider spheres; and may function on for a long
time in a kind of dreamland—creating perhaps
the objects of its own consumption till it wearies
of them, or building up imaginative worlds of
occupations and activities similar to our own, as
in “the happy hunting grounds” of Indians, or
the worlds described from time to time by mediumistic
‘controls.’ And again a third portion
may pass into that far wider and grander state
of being which we have described—that of the
‘divine’ soul which recognizes its equality and
unity with all others, and its freedom of the
whole universe. In all these cases the main
stream of memory, branching, must pour itself
into the section of life which follows, and
render the latter quite continuous with the former—though
naturally with some differences, both in
the memories transmitted, and in the degrees of
community, in each case.</p>

<p>We may apply these considerations to the question
of the messages and apparitions from the
unseen world which have been alluded to in
former chapters. How far or in what special
way these communications really represent
the active and continuing consciousness of our
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_278' id='p_278'>278</a></span>
departed friends is a question which is generally
admitted to be most doubtful and difficult. And
its difficulty is not lessened, I think, by our
conclusions (so far) on the nature of Personality.
If the stream of a man’s earth-life memory may
diverge at death into two or more streams, then
it must remain difficult for us to say whether the
communication which is coming to us proceeds
from a mere overflow of that stream, which has
eddied itself, so to speak, into the brain of
the medium; or from some ‘astral’ shell of
the departed one, which has already begun decaying
and dissipating, in our atmosphere; or again
from the true soul of the man which is pushing
forward into the world beyond. Probably we do
not yet know enough about the matter to form
decisive judgments. In either case the memory
exhibited may be surprisingly perfect. And it
seems to me that in most cases nothing but personal
evidence and personal detail, even down
to the minutest points, can decide—and even
then not in such a way as to decide for others.
And perhaps it is best and most natural so. In
our world of ordinary life it is so. If an apparent
stranger turns up from the other side of the
earth and claims a far-back acquaintance; if another
makes the same claim over the telephone;
if a known friend behaves strangely, and we are
in doubt whether to attribute his conduct to
<i>bona fides</i> or to incipient madness; in these and
a thousand other cases, personal relationship and
personal understanding (though by no means
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_279' id='p_279'>279</a></span>
unerring) count for more than all science and legal
proof. And perhaps this is the healthiest way
to take the subject: not to be over-curious or
speculative or sentimental, but where solid help
and a permanent and useful relationship seems
to be gained, there to accept the communications
as so far commending and justifying
themselves.</p>

<p>If, as I have just said, there is something a
little disquieting and even terrible in the thought
that our personality may thus be subject to rupture
or dissociation into two or more portions,
that matter after all depends upon how we look
upon it—whether from below, as it were, or from
above. There is nothing particularly terrible in
the thought that our bodily organs and parts—our
“Little Marys,” and so forth—may have
(probably do have) very distinct personalities of
their own. We look down upon them, so to
speak, and include them. And we shall one day
no doubt, and in the realization of our greater
selves, have the splendid experience of including
two (or more) bodies—of having them at our
service, and available for command and expression.
Even now we are sometimes conscious of
having one envelope of a more ethereal and intense
nature, swift and far-reaching both in movement
and perception in the innermost regions, and
another more local body, in touch with terrestrial
life. And there would be nothing surprising or
dreadful in finding, after death, that an ethereal
and a terrestrial body were both still at our
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_280' id='p_280'>280</a></span>
command—though both perhaps more developed
and more differentiated from each other than at
present;—or even that we might be capable of
inhabiting several such bodies.</p>

<p>It is of course puzzling, under our ordinary
conceptions of Space and Time, to imagine how it
could be possible to deal with several bodies at
the same time; but in reality it is no more puzzling
than the problem which we habitually solve
every day and every hour of our lives. How
do we, for instance, deal with and dispose
the activities of our hands and our feet and our
eyes and our brain, with simultaneous care, say,
in walking through the streets? We inhabit
these separate organs, these distinct personalities,
simultaneously, and ordain their movements and
gather in their perceptions by the act of <i>attention</i>.
Attention in the world of the spirit corresponds
to <i>extension</i> in the physical world. Whatever
your spirit attends to, that some physical radiation
from yourself extends to. And similarly if
you had bodies in different worlds and regions,
by the simple act of attention your spirit would
reach them. Nevertheless—to return to the one
body and the various organs, like hands and feet
and eyes, which we seem to have under control—it
is clear that our minds could not possibly overlook
all the details of their management, unless
there were some general ordaining spirit in the
body which was in close touch and sympathy, and
ready to act with and aid us; and similarly
it is clear that we could not ordain and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_281' id='p_281'>281</a></span>
organize any movement of a secondary body at
a distance—even though ‘belonging’ to us—unless
there were a spirit, in that body and the intervening
spaces, in touch and sympathy with
ours. It is the knowledge that there is such a
community of life, such an abounding Self, which
gives the ‘divine’ soul its great joy and its great
power—“for whatever he desires, that he obtains
from the Self.” He who knows has indeed the
freedom of the universe, and of all its powers—who
knows that the Spirit of the whole <i>is</i> his
own.</p>

<p>It is natural therefore to suppose that that
portion of the consciousness which has circled and
centred very definitely and conclusively round the
All-self—or such aspect of the same as specially
belongs to it; or (what perhaps comes
to the same thing) has circled very definitely
round the divine soul of a loved one; will pass
through death easily and without much loss of
continuity. It will with its attendant memories
pass easily and continuously into the inmost
sphere; or (to put the matter in another way)
<i>remaining</i> in that sphere it will simply become
aware that a mass of husks have been shed off,
which clouded it. It will become aware of the
glorious state of being to which it has always
implicitly belonged, and of its connection with
not one only but many bodies.</p>

<p>It may be—and I think one almost feels that
it must be—that the most intimate self of any of
us cannot be realized short of externalization in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_282' id='p_282'>282</a></span>
a vast number of separate manifestations or lives.
One has the impression with regard to one’s body,
that “this is one of my bodies”; or that “this
body represents a portion of myself”; but one
does <i>not</i> feel “this body represents my total, complete
and final self.” And as we have just suggested
that in a more intimate state of being we
may become distinctly aware of having relation
to several bodies simultaneously, so the
world-old doctrine of reincarnation in its general
form has long suggested that our most intimate
selves are related to a great number of bodies in
<i>succession</i> to each other in Time. The higher or
inner Individual—of agelong and æonian life—is
reincarnated (it is said) thousands of times; thus
to embody that aspect of the Divine which it
represents.</p>

<p>These embodiments may be in forms by no
means resembling each other—though doubtless
there will be a thread of similarity running
through; and one embodiment may have little
idea (except in moments of inspiration) of its
relation to the others, or of any continuity of
memory between itself and the others. Yet the
memories of these lives and embodiments passing
into the inner sphere are ultimately gathered together
and drawn up to constitute that most
glorious world of each Being of which we
have spoken—a world in which each overlooks
and ordains its various lives and manifestations
as from a mountain-top. These are
indeed “the ageless immortal gods who seek ever
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_283' id='p_283'>283</a></span>
to come in the forms of men”—whom we ever
and anon seem to feel and hear knocking at
the inner door of our little local selves, as
though they would gain admittance and acknowledgment.</p>

<h1 id='t8847'>CHAPTER XVI<br/>&ensp;<br/>CONCLUSION</h1>

<p><span class='sc'>And</span> so we seem to find—in the farthest and loftiest
reaches of life, as in its first beginnings—Love
and Death strangely linked and strangely
related. Changing their form but not their essence
they accompany us to the last; and we forebode
them, in the final account, as no longer the
tyrannous and often terrible over-lords of our
mortal days, but rather our most indispensable
companions without whom life in its higher
ranges could not well be maintained.</p>

<p>For a time, certainly, we cling to our limited
and tiny self-life and consciousness; and deem
that all good resides in the careful guarding of
the same. But again there comes a time when
the bounds of personality confine and chafe beyond
endurance, when an immense rage sweeps
us far out into the great ocean; when to save our
lives we deliberately lose them; when Death becomes
a passion even as Love is.</p>

<p>The mystery of mortal life clears, or dissolves
away, by our passing in a sense beyond personality;
and the hour arrives when we look down on
these local days, these self-limitations, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_285' id='p_285'>285</a></span>
phases—phases of some far vaster state of being.
Death is the necessary door by which we pass
from one such phase to another; and Love is
even a similar door.</p>

<p>Growing silently within there emerges at last
something which has its home in the great spaces,
which dives under and through Death, and is the
companion of Titanic and Cosmic beings; something
strangely surpassing all barriers and limits,
and strangely finding identity by fusing and losing
it in the life of others; something which at times
seems almost mockingly to abandon its own identity
and rise creative in new forms—sporting in
the great ocean; and yet can somehow instantly
recall its past and the tiny limits from which it
first sprang—trailing forever with it the wonderful
cloud-wreaths of earth-memory and association,
and the myriad fragrance of personal remembrance.
“What are thou then?” says the
poet, addressing his departed friend:—</p>

<div class='poetry-container'><div class='lgp'>
<p class='line0'>“What art thou then?—I cannot guess;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;But tho’ I seem in star and flower</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To feel thee some diffusive power</p>
<p class='line0'>I do not therefore love thee less.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Even in the farthest spheres the poignant syllables
‘I’ and ‘Thou’ will surely still be heard; and
a thousand deaths shall not avail to exhaust their
meaning or to make of Love a pale and cold abstraction.</p>

<p>The memory of the earth-life and of personal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_286' id='p_286'>286</a></span>
identity is never lost; but it passes out into that
far greater form, the memory and resumption
into a coherent Whole of many lives, and the
sense of an Individuality which has value because
it is merged in and is an expression of the All.
Memory indeed changes from being the faint
dream-shadow that we know, of things in the
past, to being the things <i>themselves</i>, actual and
ever present at our command; and with this finding
of the inner soul and heart’s core of all beings
it becomes possible to live over again with them
the days gone by, in all detail and with ever
deeper understanding of their true meaning.</p>

<p>The supra-liminal returns into harmony with
the subliminal; the individual life and the mass-life
are reunited. With the overpassing of the
local and terrestrial self we are liberated into a
fluid region where a thousand personalities yield
their secrets and their co-operation into our hands.
With the releasing of our attention from personal
objects and terrestrial gains, materials and people
correspondingly cease to obstruct. They find
nothing which they <i>can</i> obstruct! The body
moves freely about the world; life ceases to be
the ‘obstacle race’ and the queer perpetual vista
of barricades which it mostly now is; and <i>a fortiori</i>
the soul moves freely, because truly for
the redeemed soul it is possible to feel that all
things and creatures are friendly, all beings a part
of itself. These and many other such realizations
are indeed possible now—even in our present terrestrial
state—under those rare conditions when
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_287' id='p_287'>287</a></span>
the divine creature which is within the mortal
body achieves a momentary deliverance, and
under which we sometimes pass out of our little
mundane dream into that other land where the
great Voices sound and Visions dwell.</p>

<h1 id='t8950'>APPENDIX</h1>


<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_290' id='p_290'>290</a></span>
<h2 id='t8954'>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>1. Every kind of cell or other organism has a natural
limit of size (dependent partly on the relation between
surface and volume).</p>

<p>2. When that limit is reached, superfluity of nutrition
and growth tends to bring about Reproduction.</p>

<p>3. Reproduction begins with simple division or budding.</p>

<p>4. Conjugation in its primitive form (as among protozoa
where there is no distinction of sex) takes place
between similars, and is an exchange to some degree of
cell-contents.</p>

<p>5. It apparently affords a superior nutrition, and is
a kind of Regeneration, essential to the continued health
of the species, and favorable to reproduction.</p>

<p>6. Hunger and Love are thus related at this stage.</p>

<p>7. Later, conjugation takes place between dissimilars
(of the same species); and the distinct phenomena of
sex appear—of male and female.</p>

<p>8. Reproduction by simple division or budding leads to
a kind of ‘immortality,’ since each descendant cell is
continuous, in a sense, with the original one.</p>

<p>9. This simple division or virgin-birth process may
go on to many generations—even to hundreds among
the Protozoa.</p>

<p>10. But since at some time or other conjugation is
apparently necessary in order to restore vitality, the
immortality at this point ceases to be an individual immortality,
and becomes rather a joint or racial immortality.</p>

<p>11. The main thing in conjugation would appear to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_291' id='p_291'>291</a></span>
be that the two factors should be complementary to each
other, however differentiated, so that in their union the
whole race-life should be restored, and the Regeneration
therefore be complete.</p>

<p>12. The special sex-differentiation called male and
female depends on the separation of the active from the
sessile qualities (and other qualities respectively related
to each) into two great branches.</p>

<p>13. Since the female takes the sessile part she appears
sometimes as the goal and object of conjugation, and the
more important factor; but actual observation so far
shows each factor, male and female, to be equally important.</p>

<p>14. In the fertilized ovum there are an equal number
of chromosomes derived from each parent; and if the
female provides the shrine in which the new development
takes place, the male (centrosome) appears as the
organizing genius of the process.</p>

<p>15. This process, by which a fertilized germ-cell divides
and redivides, and so builds up a “body,” is quite
similar to that by which a protozoön divides and redivides
to form a numerous colony.</p>

<p>16. A ‘body’ indeed <i>is</i> such a colony, coöperatively
associated in definite form, of which all the millions of
cells are practically continuous with the original fertilized
germ, and one with it.</p>

<p>17. Every cell in such a body has apparently the same
nuclear elements as the original cell, equally derived
from both parents; but is differentiated so far as to be
able to fulfil its special part in the body.</p>

<p>18. The process of division of these microscopic cells
is strangely exact and complex; and the various elements
of the nucleus seem to be themselves divided into two,
on each occasion, with strange preciseness.</p>

<p>19. The constituent cells of each race of animals have
always a certain number of nuclear threads or chromosomes—fixed
for that particular race.</p>

<p>20. When, therefore, a sperm-cell and germ-cell unite,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='p_292' id='p_292'>292</a></span>
they each first extrude or expel half the number of their
chromosomes, so that after union the joint cell is provided
again with the precise number of chromosomes
characteristic of the race.</p>

<p>21. The exact nature of these ‘maturation’ divisions
and expulsions is far from clear; but it would seem that
they are carried out in such a way as, while retaining
always the basic elements of the Race, to secure a continual
and endless sorting of these into new combinations.</p>

<p>22. These complex evolutions occurring, as described,
in the interior of the most primitive cells, look as much
like the last results of some far antecedent or invisible
operations (of which we know nothing) as like the first
commencement of the visible organic world with which
we are acquainted.</p>

<p>“In November 1885, M. Maupas isolated an infusorian
(<i>Stylonichia pustulata</i>), and observed its generations till March
1886. By that time there had been 215 generations produced by
ordinary division, and since these lowly organisms do not conjugate
with near relatives, there had of course been no sexual
union.—What was the result? At the date referred to, the
family was observed to have exhausted itself. The members,
though not exactly old, were being born old. The sexual
division came to a standstill, and the powers of nutrition were
also lost” (<i>Evolution of Sex</i>, Geddes and Thomson, 1901, p.

<p>Stephane Leduc, in his <i>Théorie Physico-chémique de la vie</i>

the simple action of diffusion and osmose (see ch. viii, on

forms above described to diffusion-figures is interesting—as
also is their resemblance to the forms of magnetic fields—this
does not prove their genesis either from diffusion or magnetism.

<p>It might be said that, notwithstanding this, the female
obviously has the greater sway, on account of the conjunction
taking place within the body of the mother, and subject to
all her influences. But there is a curious compensation to this
in the fact that while after conjugation the centrosome of the
germ-cell disappears, the male centrosome is retained and becomes
the organ of division for the new cell, and consequently
for the whole future body. (See <i>Parallel Paths</i>, p. 56; also

<p>“The disgrace which has overtaken the sexual act, and
rendered it a deed of darkness, is doubtless largely responsible
for the fact that the chief time for its consummation among
modern civilized peoples is the darkness of the early night in
stuffy bedrooms when the fatigue of the day’s labors is
struggling with the artificial stimulation produced by heavy
meals and alcoholic drinks. This habit is partly responsible
for the indifference or even disgust with which women sometimes
view coitus” (H. Ellis, <i>Studies in the Psychology of

<p>The only alternative to this seems to be to suppose that
the “soul” comes into association with the body, not at the
very first inception of the latter, but at some later pre-natal
or post-natal stage, when the body is already partially or
wholly built up by the primitive process of cell-division—that
the soul then takes possession of the organism so formed, and
makes use of it for self-expression; and finally at death discards
it. This theory—though it seems a possible one, and
in accordance with the apparent “possession” and control of
the bodies of trance mediums by independent spirits—presents
some difficulties. One difficulty is the absence of any obvious
or acknowledged period when such entry of the soul takes
place; another is the difficulty of seeing how a real and effective
harmony could be permanently established between a body
already formed and organized on hereditary lines, and an independent
soul entering on its own errand at a later date. These
(and other) difficulties, however, are not insuperable, and it
may well be, in the great variety of Nature, that the process
of incarnation actually does take place in both ways—<i>i.e.</i> in
the way outlined in this note, as well as (more generally) in
the way mentioned in the text.</p>

<p>The <i>Upanishads</i>, whose authority on these subjects is
surely great, seem often to try to express the other-dimensional
nature of the soul by a paradox of opposites. “The
self, smaller than small (or more subtle than subtle), greater
than great, is hidden in the heart of each creature” (Katha-Up.
I. Adh. 2 valli. 20; also Svetasvatara-Up. III. Adh. 20)—or
again, “The embodied soul is to be thought like the hundredth
part of the point of a hair, divided into a hundred
parts; he is to be thought infinite” (Svet.-Up. v. 9). And
the last quoted passage continues: “He is not woman, he is
not man, nor hermaphrodite; whatever body he assumes, with
that he is joined (only); and as by the use of food and drink
the body grows, so the individual soul, by means of thoughts,
touching, seeing and the passions, assumes successively in various
places various forms in accordance with his deeds.”</p>

that it is only made up of successive and separate sensations

another and profounder and more continuous consciousness
beneath, which is the means of the synthesis and comparison

<p>With regard to this question of hypnotism and crime,
T. J. Hudson says (<i>Psychic Phenomena</i>, p. 129) that it is almost
impossible to persuade a hypnotic to do what he firmly
believes to be wrong. And Myers maintains that whatever the
subliminal being may be, it is never malignant. “In dealing
with automatic script, for instance, we shall have to wonder
whence come the occasional vulgar jokes or silly mystifications.
We shall discuss whether they are a kind of dream of the
automatist’s own, or whether they indicate the existence of
unembodied intelligences on the level of the dog or the ape.
But, on the other hand, all that world-old conception of
Evil Spirits, of malevolent powers, which has been the basis
of so much of actual devil-worship and so much more of vague
supernatural fear—all this insensibly melts from the mind
as we study the evidence before us.” (<i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 252.)</p>

<p>The cobwebby sensation alluded to above is often mentioned
by other writers. Dr. J. Maxwell, in his <i>Metaphysical
Phenomena</i> (Duckworth, 1905), p. 329, describes a case in
which the radiation of force from the fingers of a medium was
great enough to move a small statuette five or six inches distant,
and absolutely without contact; but the phenomenon was
accompanied by a “Spider-web or cobwebby sensation in the
hands.” The author of that interesting book <i>Interwoven</i>
(Boston, 1905, copyright by S. L. Ford), speaks of “the
protoplasmic vapor of the inner man,” and says (p. 15): “It is
this frail vapor which comes out at death and tries to form
into spiritual body”; and again (p. 19): “I notice at death
that nature draws or relieves the fire of the ganglia first and
all the lines of sensation in light which were running down
the nerves. It looks like white seaweed, very light and airy
and fragile ... a veil of shining which is scarcely substance
because of its white fire.”</p>

<p>It seems probable, from many considerations, that at a
certain depth within us—in the region of what has been called
the cosmic consciousness—memory does in nowise fade, and
the past is always present, but, as Bergson says, the ordinary

needed for impending action, and has consequently become
limited by this tendency.</p>

<p>It may easily be understood, I think, that the process by
which the distinct soul is thus built up may last several lifetimes.
That is, there may be a long period during which the
budding soul still entangled in the race-life may be reincarnated
jointly with the race-soul in a kind of mixed way—family
and race-characteristics mingling with and obscuring its
expression—though these incarnations would become ever less
mixed and more individual in character till the day of the
soul’s final disentanglement.</p>
